### Why is this important?

Keyboard users navigate through the operable elements on the page by pressing the Tab key.
All sighted keyboard users (and those relying on the keyboard interface, such as voice-command and switch users) need to be able to see the element that has keyboard focus,
otherwise, they have no context about where they are or what to do.

An off-screen or invisible (zero-sized or clipped) keyboard-focusable element has been found.
In some cases, the Checker can't detect where JavaScript is repositioning or resizing elements when they have keyboard focus.
This requires some human review to confirm that the element should receive keyboard focus, and if so, doesn't remain off-screen or impossible to see when it does get keyboard focus.
If it should not be operable with the keyboard and is not removed from the tab order,
people using a screen reader will "see" the element even though it's invisible, which will cause confusion. 

Normally, keyboard-focusable (tabbable) elements should be visible, 
but there are situations where it is acceptable to "hide" and then reveal the element when it receives keyboard focus,
as in the '**Skip to main content**' example below. 

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

- If users _should not_ be able to interact with this element using the keyboard, set the `tabindex="-1"` attribute to remove the element from the tab order
- **Or**, if users _should_ be able to interact with this element using the keyboard, use the Tab key to confirm it is visible on screen when it has keyboard focus
- **And**, if the interactive element is off-screen when it receives keyboard focus, use the pseudo class `:focus` or adjust the position style (see example)
- **And**, ensure the focus is visible as specified in [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#2_4_7)


Example: this "**_Skip to main content_**" tabbable element uses CSS positioning to ensure it is visible when the element has keyboard focus:

```
    <style>
    .skip {
        position: absolute; background-color: white; padding: 0.5rem;
        left: -1000px;
    }
    .skip:focus {
        left: 1rem;
    }
    </style>
    <a class="skip" href="#main">Skip to main content</a>   
```

                <div id="ruleInfo"></div>

            <div class="bx--col-sm-4 bx--col-md-3 bx--col-lg-4 toolSide">

### About this requirement

* [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#2_4_7)
* [Unit test - check tab order](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/considerations/unit-testing/#check-tab-order)
* [Unit test - confirm component keyboard interaction](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/considerations/unit-testing/#confirm-component-keyboard-interaction) 

### Who does this affect?

* People who rely on keyboard control
* People with dexterity impairment using voice control or a keyboard-like switch device
* People with low vision who use screen magnification with keyboard control
* People using a screen reader, including blind, low vision and neurodivergent people
* Neurodivergent people who use the keyboard
* Older adults who use the keyboard
