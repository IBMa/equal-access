### Why is this important?

Assistive technologies can present different types of combobox to their users according to their 
intended behavior. The `"inline"` value for the `aria-autocomplete` attribute is not valid for a 
combobox text entry element, so assistive technologies may be unable to operate it. A combobox that 
supports inline forms of autocomplete would do this in combination with having a popup element, and 
should use `aria-autocomplete="both"`.

Additionally, a combobox is a UI interactive component that combines an input and another element, 
such as a listbox or grid, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set the value of the input. 
Only the text entry element can have the `aria-autocomplete` attribute, otherwise assistive technologies
may be unable to understand and present the component's autocomplete functionality effectively.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If the combobox has autocomplete behavior that includes both inline text appearing after the user's cursor and a popup element, use `aria-autocomplete="both"`;
* **Or**, if the combobox has autocomplete behavior provided only through a popup element, use `aria-autocomplete="list"`;
* **Or**, if the combobox does not have autocomplete behavior, remove the `aria-autocomplete` attribute (the default value is `"none"`).

Also,
* Remove the `aria-autocomplete` attribute from popup elements of the combobox
* **And**, if autocomplete behavior is desired, verify that the text input element of the combobox has the `aria-autocomplete` attribute.

For example:

```
<label for="comboInput">State</label>
<div class="combobox">
    <div class="cbPrimary">
    <input type="text" id="comboInput" class="cbEdit"
        role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
        aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
        aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="cb-ak" />
    <button id="cbButton" tabindex="-1" aria-label="Open">▼</button>
    </div>
    <ul id="popup_listbox" role="listbox" aria-label="States">
    <li id="cb-al" role="option">Alabama</li>
    <li id="cb-ak" role="option" aria-selected="true">Alaska</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
