### Why is this important?

The HTML `<q>` and `<blockquote>` elements tell assistive technologies such as screen readers which content is part of a quotation or citation. Any such text must be included in the appropriate element that enables assistive technology users to understand its meaning and purpose.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify the text is not a quotation;
 * **Or**, if the quotation is 10 words or less, enclose it in a `<q>` element;
 * **Or**, for a longer quotation, enclose it in a `<blockquote>` element.

For example:

```
<p>As she walked up she said, <q>Hi, my name is Natasha.</q></p>
    
<p>Quotation from <cite="https://www.shakespeare.com/loveslabourlost">Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
    Painfully to pore upon a book
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
</blockquote>
```
