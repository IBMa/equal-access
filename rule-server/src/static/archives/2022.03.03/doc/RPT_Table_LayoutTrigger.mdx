### Verify table is not being used to format text content in columns unless the table can be linearized

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Avoid using tables to format text documents in columns unless the table can be linearized

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Some users consume a linearized version of a Web page, with each element following the previous one. In linearized form, tables are read from cell to cell horizontally across each row, moving down the rows from top to bottom. If this reading order is not appropriate for the content, users will not be able to make sense of it.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * If a table is being used for presentation purposes, separate content from presentation by using CSS instead of a table to achieve the desired layout;
 * **Or**, if a table must be used, add `role="none"` and structure the table so that a left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading of the table gives a natural reading order for the content.
