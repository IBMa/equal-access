### Check whether ASCII art has a text alternative

<div id="locLevel"></div>

ASCII art must have a text alternative

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

ASCII art cannot be read out by assistive technologies. Providing a text alternative makes the information available in a non-visual format. A link to skip the ASCII art saves users from having to read through large quantities of seemingly nonsense characters.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * If this element is not ASCII art but meaningful text, no action is needed;
 * **Or**, if this is ASCII art, verify there is a text alternative immediately before or after it. A link to skip the ASCII art is also recommended.

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
