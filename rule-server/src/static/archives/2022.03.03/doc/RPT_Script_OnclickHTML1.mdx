### Possible use of a script to emulate a link

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Scripts should not be used to emulate links

### Why is this important?

Sometimes JavaScript event handlers are attached to page elements to emulate links, for example by placing an `"onclick"` on a &lt;`span`&gt; or &lt;`div`&gt;. When this is done, the element doesnâ€™t provide link semantic information to assistive technologies and does not automatically provide the keyboard accessibility. User agents might not be able to identify this content as a link. Individuals will not be able to tab to the link using their keyboard. They might find it hard to determine that interactive controls are available or to understand what type of behavior to expect.

### What to do

 * Wherever possible, do not use scripts to emulate an HTML link. Use `<a href>` or `<area>` to implement links;
 * **Or**, if scripting must be used, add the attribute `role="link"` to the element and [implement keyboard accessibility](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#2_1_1).
