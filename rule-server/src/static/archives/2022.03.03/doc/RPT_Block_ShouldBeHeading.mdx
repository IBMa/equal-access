### Check text that looks like a heading but is not within a heading element

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Heading text must use a heading element

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

HTML heading elements are used by assistive technologies to recognize headings on a page. Headings provide a good overview of the structure of a page and allow users to quickly find and navigate to different sections of interest.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * If this text is intended to be a heading, use the `<h>` elements (h1-h6) rather than style alone to define heading text (e.g. `<h2>Section 1</h2>`);
 * **Or**, use other markup so the element's semantic meaning is exposed to assistive technology that is appropriate for the content of the element.
