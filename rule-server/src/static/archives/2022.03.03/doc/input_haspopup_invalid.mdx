### An `<input>` element with `list` attribute also uses `aria-haspopup` attribute

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The `<input>` element with a `list` attribute **_should not_** also use a `aria-haspopup` attribute

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

* Input types of 
[text](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#text-%28type=text%29-state-and-search-state-%28type=search%29), [search](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#text-%28type=text%29-state-and-search-state-%28type=search%29), [tel](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#telephone-state-%28type=tel%29), [url](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#url-state-%28type=url%29), and [email](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#e-mail-state-%28type=email%29) 
(or inputs with a missing or invalid type) that also have a [list](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#attr-input-list) attribute have an implicit role of combobox, which in turn has an implicit `aria-haspopup="listbox"`;
therefore, developers should not explicitly assign the `aria-haspopup` attribute, which will be either redundant or possibly conflicting.
When HTML elements use both `aria-*` attributes and their HTML implied equivalents, browsers **_must_** ignore the explicit (redundant or conflicting) ARIA attribute â€“ the native HTML attribute with their [implied ARIA semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#implicit_semantics) take precedence.

* To ensure that Assistive Technologies (AT) can gather information, proper coding is required so that the end users can understand and interact with the content.
If standard HTML controls are created according to specification, the conditions of this provision will be met.
For this reason, to avoid unintended consequences, developers **_should not_** specify both the native HTML attribute and an equivalent (redundant or conflicting) `aria-haspopup` attribute on the indicated inputs with a `list` attribute.
Otherwise, any global `aria-*` attributes and any other `aria-*` attributes applicable to the combobox role **_may_** be used.

### What to do

* Remove the `aria-haspopup` attribute from the `<input>` element that has a `list` attribute with input `type=` 
[text](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#text-%28type=text%29-state-and-search-state-%28type=search%29), [search](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#text-%28type=text%29-state-and-search-state-%28type=search%29), [tel](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#telephone-state-%28type=tel%29), [url](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#url-state-%28type=url%29), or [email](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#e-mail-state-%28type=email%29).
* **And/Or**, add an input type if missing or correct the invalid input type.
