### UI component has no focusable child element

<div id="locLevel"></div>

UI component must have at least one focusable child element for keyboard access

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Setting the `tabindex` value to 0 or -1 on a child element not focusable by default ensures the UI component will be included in the tab sequence and receive focus for keyboard access. Using values greater than 0 should be avoided as it can break the logical tab order.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Set the value of the `tabindex` attribute equal to 0 or -1 on at least one of the required child elements to include the UI component in the tab sequence. 

The following example shows a component with `role="tree"` with its required child with `role="treeitem"`. The child contains `tabindex="0"` which makes the `treeitem` keyboard operable:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>&lt;div role="tree" aria-label="Tree Widget" id="tree1" onkeypress="keyEvent();"&gt;
    &lt;div id="item1" role="treeitem" tabindex="0"&gt;Tree item&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  </CodeSnippet>

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
