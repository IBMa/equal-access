### Filename used as label for embedded audio or video

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Audio or video on the page must have a short text alternative that describes the media content

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Proper text alternatives convey the meaning of what the non-text content such as audio or video content is. Placeholder text or filenames are not viable labels because they do not convey function or information; for example, filenames such as "video.jpg" or "interviewOct.wav".

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Provide a short text alternative as a label that describes the content of the audio or video on the page.

For example: A video feed in NY Times has the following descriptive label "Video of the fine dining place 'Clay Pit' located in downtown Austin, TX."

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
