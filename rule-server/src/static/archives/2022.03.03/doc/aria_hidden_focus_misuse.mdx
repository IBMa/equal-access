### A focusable element should not be within the subtree of an element with `aria-hidden` set to `"true"` 

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Element with `aria-hidden="true"` should not have focusable content

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Using either `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on a focusable element will result in some users focusing on "nothing".
A focusable element with `aria-hidden="true"` is ignored as part of the reading order, 
but still part of the focus order, 
making its state of visible or hidden unclear.
This rule checks that elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute do not contain focusable elements.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

When designers and developers want to hide parts of a web page that are pure decoration, 
such as icon fonts - that are not meant to be read by assistive technologies:

* ensure that assistive technologies will ignore the element by adding `aria-hidden="true"` to the element
* enure none of the target elements are part of sequential focus navigation
* ensure no descendants are part of sequential focus navigation 

### Example

* In the following example, the `button` element is focusable by default. 
Therefore, using `aria-hidden="true"` violates the rule: 
<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>
        &lt;div aria-hidden="true"&gt;
            &lt;div aria-hidden="false"&gt;
                &lt;button&gt;Some button&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
</CodeSnippet>

Note: Using `aria-hidden="false"` on a descendant of an element with `aria-hidden="true"` does not expose that element.
Using `aria-hidden="true"` hides itself and all its content from assistive technologies.
