### The 'headers' attribute does not refer to a valid cell

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The 'headers' attribute should refer to one or more valid cells in the same table

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

The `headers` attribute specifies one or more header cells related to a table cell in a complex table. It has no visual effect on the table, but it provides a programmatic way for assistive technology such as screen readers to describe visual relationships between header and data cells. When a table has multi-level headers, it can become difficult to convey which header text applies to any one cell using only `<th>` elements and `scope` attributes. The `headers` attribute allows for the concatenation of multiple `<th>` text into an accurate descriptor for an individual data cell.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Ensure the `headers` attribute references the `id` of one or more valid cells in the same table

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
