import "../../../styles/ToolHelp.scss"

<div className="toolHelp">
<Row>
<Column colLg={16} colMd={8} colSm={4} className="toolHead">

### Confirm the 'meta[name=viewport]' with " maximum-scale=1.5" can be zoomed by user

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The 'meta[name=viewport]' should not prevent the browser zooming the content

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Users who need magnification with older mobile browsers may not be able to zoom the content.
Desktop browsers ignore the viewport meta element, 
and most modern mobile browsers either ignore it by default or have an accessibility option which will allow zooming.
Only users with older mobile browsers can experience issues tested by this rule.

This rule is designed specifically for testing [1.4.4 Resize text](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#1_4_4), 
which requires that text can be resized up to 200%. 
Because text that cannot be resized up to 200% cannot fit in an area of 320 by 256 CSS pixels, 
this rule maps to [1.4.10 Reflow](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#1_4_10) as well. 

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Confirm the page provides zoom controls for the content up to 200%
* **Or**, remove the `user-scalable` and/or `maximum-scale` attribute
* **Or**, set the `user-scalable` attribute to "yes" and/or the `maximum-scale` to at least "2"

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
