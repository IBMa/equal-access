<Column colLg={16} colMd={8} colSm={4} className="toolHead">

### Confirm the pointer can hover over the displayed element, not just the trigger

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The pointer should be able to move over content displayed on hover

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When content displays on hover, the pointer should be able to move from the trigger to the new content. If the new content disappears when the pointer leaves the trigger element, users who significantly magnify their screen will never be able to bring the new content into view to read.


<div id="locSnippet"></div>


### What to do

* If using the css `hover` pseudo-class on one element in order to set a `display` style on another element, the displayed element must be a child of the trigger element;
* **Or**, the newly displayed element must be the adjacent sibling of the trigger, with its own `hover` set to `display`, and with no `margin` property set (since the margin separates the two elements and prevents the hover display from persisting).

Note: Use of the `~` selector with the `display` style attribute can allow many siblings of the trigger element to be displayed on hover; however, only its adjacent sibling will persistently display when the pointer is moved from the trigger towards the displayed content. 


The recommended code example is:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>
{`<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
      <style>
          div {background-color: yellow;padding: 20px;display: none;}
		  span:hover div {display: block;
        <div>I will show on hover</div>
      </span>
  </body>
</html>
</html>`}
</CodeSnippet>

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
