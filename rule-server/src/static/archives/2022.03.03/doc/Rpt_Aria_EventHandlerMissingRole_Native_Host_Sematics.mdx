### The element does not have a valid ARIA role specified.

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Elements with event handlers must have a valid ARIA role

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When UI elements are programmed with script to receive focus and be interactive, setting a valid `role` attribute or using an element with an implicit role allows assistive technologies to provide information about and manage an interactive element appropriately, including providing keyboard operability.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * If using native HTML, determine why the element does not have an implicit role and address the cause (e.g., &lt;`a`&gt; does not have a role of `link` unless it also has an `href` attribute);
 * **Or**, change the element type to one with an implicit role that matches the behavior of the element (e.g., use &lt;`button`&gt; instead of &lt;`div`&gt;);
 * **Or**, assign a valid ARIA `role` that reflects the behavior of the element (e.g., use &lt;`div role="button"`&gt;).

</Column>
