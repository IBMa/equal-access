### Why is this important?

If an ARIA `role` attribute is specified for an element, the child elements required for that role must also be present. 
Child elements' implied (native HTML) roles may satisfy the requirement - the role does not have to be explicitly set by ARIA. 
Any incorrect child element roles also need to be removed. For example, `role="group"` is not a valid child of `list`.
Without the correct required child element roles, assistive technologies may not be able to accurately represent the context or be able to interact with the element.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Add the appropriate required child element(s) to this element
 * *Or*, remove any incorrect child element(s)

Example with a `"radiogroup"` that requires child elements with `role="radio"` set in a manner that represents the checked or unchecked state of the radio button:

```
<div role="radiogroup">
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="false"></div>
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="true"></div>
</div>
```

Example with an implicit role:

```
<table role= "treegrid">
     <tr>
         <td>
            element with role="treegrid" requires child element with role="row".
            TR has implicit ARIA role="row", so the condition is met.
         <td>
     <tr>
</table>
```

### About this requirement

* [IBM 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#4_1_2)
* [ARIA authoring practices guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
* [ARIA specification - Required Owned Elements](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#mustContain)

**Note**: this rule's level was lowered from a "Violation" to a "Recommendation" temporarily.
In some cases, such as `listitems` only being allowed inside `lists`, 
assistive technology works around the strict specification and correctly renders the child elements.
An investigation of the AIRA specification is on-going to determine the strictness of the parent-child interpretation.
In most cases this rule should be interpreted as a "Violation" and remediated as explained above. 

### Who does this affect?

* People using a screen reader, including blind, low vision and neurodivergent people
