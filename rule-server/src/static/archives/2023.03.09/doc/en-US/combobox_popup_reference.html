### Why is this important?

A combobox combines a text input element and a popup element that helps the user set the value of the 
input. The popup becomes visible when the combobox is in an expanded state and is controlled by using 
an attribute `aria-controls` referencing its `id`. When the value of the `aria-controls` attribute of
the expanded combobox does not reference a valid popup `id`, assistive 
technologies may not be able to present and control the content correctly.

Additionally, when the element with `role="combobox"` has an `aria-expanded` attribute with value `true`,
the related popup element must be visible so that the assistive technology is able to present the
popup to the user.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do


 * Code the combobox as in the ARIA 1.2 example below;
 * **And**, set the value of the combobox `aria-controls` attribute to the `id` value of an element with `role="listbox"`;
 * **Or**, if using the ARIA 1.0 style of combobox, update the value of the `aria-owns` attribute of the combobox to reference the `id` value of the combobox popup element;

```
<label for="tag_combo">Tag</label>
  <input type="text" id="tag_combo"
      role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
      aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
      aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="selected_option">
  <ul role="listbox" id="popup_listbox">
   <li role="option">Zebra</li>
   <li role="option" id="selected_option">Zoom</li>
  </ul>
```
