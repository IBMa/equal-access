### Why is this important?

Providing a transcript makes information presented through speech, sound effects, music, and so on available to any user.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify that the audio content is also available in text form;
 * OR, provide a transcript of the audio.

For example, a link to an audio file containing a speech would be followed by a link to a page with a transcript:

    &lt;a href="bc30.txt"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;)</CodeSnippet>
