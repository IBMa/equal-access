### Why is this important?

Some people cannot use a mouse, pen, or touch to drag items.
Examples of draggable elements include list items, text, and images.
The design should not rely on dragging as the only means for the userâ€™s actions.

- **_Draggable_**: an operation where the pointer (mouse, pen, or touch) engages with an element on the [down-event](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html#dfn-down-event) and the element (or a representation of its position) follows the pointer until an [up-event](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html#dfn-up-event).
- **_Single-pointer_**: one or several pointer inputs that operate with _one point of contact with the screen_, including single taps and clicks, double-taps and double-clicks, and long presses.
- **_Path-based gesture_**: involves a pointer interaction where not just the endpoints matter.
- **_Exceptions and additional terms_**: are defined at [Understanding Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html#key-terms).

Note: This requirement is separate from keyboard accessibility. 
However, providing a text input can be an acceptable _single-pointer_ alternative to dragging. 
For example, a text input beside a slider could allow any user to enter a precise value for the slider. 
In such a situation, the on-screen keyboard for touch users offers a _single-pointer_ means of entering an alphanumeric value.

### What to do

For any action that involves dragging with a mouse, pen, or touch:
- Provide a _single-pointer_ alternative, such as including single taps and clicks, double-taps and double-clicks, and long presses as alternatives to the dragging
- **Or**, provide a text input alternative

### About this requirement

- [IBM 2.5.7 Dragging Movements](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/?version=v7_3#2_5_7)
- [G219: an alternative _single-pointer_ interaction that does not involve dragging](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G219)
- [Failure F108: Not providing a _single-pointer_ method that does not require dragging](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F108)

### Who does this affect?

- People who struggle with performing dragging movements 
- People with tremors or other movement disorders using a mouse, stylus, or touch input
- People using a device in environments where they are exposed to shaking, such as public transportation
- Many older adults
