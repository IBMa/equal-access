### Why is this important?

Many assistive technology users rely on using the keyboard to navigate to and operate interactive components.
Users expect that authors will not remove certain elements from the tab sequence.

Unlike native HTML form elements and controls, browsers do not provide keyboard support for custom ARIA widgets,
such as menus and grids, as well as interactive ARIA components, such as toolbars and dialogs.
Authors have to provide keyboard support in their code to manage the movement of keyboard focus between components,
e.g., how the focus moves when the `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keys are pressed.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* After deciding that the component should be keyboard-interactive, use the `tabindex` attribute to include the component in the tab sequence
* Otherwise, change the role to a non-widget or non-interactive type component so there is no expectation that the component should be operable with the keyboard

* [ARIA practices - Developing a Keyboard Interface](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/)
* [ARIA specification - Widget Roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-wai-aria-1.2-20230606/#widget_roles)    

### Who does this affect?

* People using a screen reader, including blind, low vision, and neurodivergent people
* People who physically cannot use a pointing device
* People with tremors or other movement disorders using a keyboard-like switch device
* People using a keyboard and alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators, like speech input software and on-screen keyboards
