### Why is this important?

The primary keyboard navigation convention uses `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keys to move focus from one UI component to another.
Other keys (primarily the arrow keys) move focus within components comprised of multiple focusable elements.
Authors must follow this convention and provide no more than one tab stop per component (providing keyboard focus) and insure the keyboard tab sequence is logical.
In addition, the keyboard operations should be consistent with common keyboard interface conventions described in the [ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/), especially for assistive technology users.

### What to do

* Modify the widgetâ€™s keyboard navigation model to contain only one tab stop to set focus in or on the widget.
