### Why is this important?

Regions (sections) on a page may contain headings, content, white space, and even nested regions for users to better consume the content. 
Landmarks for the regions help assistive technology (AT) users orient themselves to the page and help them easily navigate to various regions of a page. 
When multiple regions with the same role exist on the same page, people using screen readers, voice control, 
and other ATs will have difficulty identifying or distinguishing between them 
(e.g., where there are two or more `"navigation"` regions).

Landmarks are inserted into the page using the `role` attribute on an element that marks the region. 
The `role` values listed below are the names of the landmark types:
  
* `"banner"`: A region that contains the prime heading or title of a page.
* `"complementary"`: Any section of the page that supports the main content, yet is separate and meaningful on its own.
* `"contentinfo"`: A region that contains information about the parent page such as copyrights and links to privacy statements.
* `"form"`: A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing.
* `"main"`: Main content in a document. In almost all cases a page will have only one `role="main"`.
* `"navigation"`: A collection of links suitable for use when navigating the page or related pages.
* `"region"`: A section sufficiently important that users will likely want to be able to navigate to the section easily. Use of `role="region"` should be limited to sections containing content with a purpose that is not accurately described by one of the other landmark roles. Each `role="region"` **must**  have a brief label that describes the purpose of the content in the region.
* `"search"`: A region for searching content.

### What to do
  
* Use unique `aria-labelledby` values to distinguish landmarks with the same `role`
* **Or**, use unique `aria-label` values to distinguish landmarks with the same `role`
* **Or**, nest landmarks in different parent regions to distinguish those with the same `role`
