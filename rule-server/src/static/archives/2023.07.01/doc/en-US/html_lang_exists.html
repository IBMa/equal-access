### Why is this important?

Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages can adapt to the pronunciation and syntax that are specific to the language, speaking the text in the correct language with proper pronunciation. Some screen readers can be configured to automatically switch languages based on the `lang` attribute.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Identify the default language of the HTML document by providing the `lang` attribute on the HTML element (e.g. `<html lang="en">`);
* **Or**, if serving an XML document only (ie. using a MIME type such as application/xhtml+xml), identify the default language by providing the `xml:lang` attribute alone. The `lang` attribute is not needed (`<html xml:lang="fr" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">`)
* **Or**, if serving XHTML 1.x or polyglot pages as text/html, use both the `lang` attribute and the `xml:lang` attribute and ensure the values for both attributes are identical (`<html lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">`)
