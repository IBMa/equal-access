### Why is this important?

Changing the value of an input does not typically result in a [change of context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-focus.html#dfn-changes-of-context). If it does, this can be very disorientating to users who cannot see the changes. It is important that users are told in advance that the change of context will occur. For example, if filling in the final field of a form causes the form to be submitted, this should be made clear before the user interacts with it.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify that changing the input element's value does not cause a [change of context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-focus.html#dfn-changes-of-context);
 * **Or**, verify that the Web page explains what will happen when values are selected for this input component. This explanation must appear earlier in the reading order than the component itself;
 * **Or**, add an explanation as described;
 * **Or**, trigger the change of context on an explicit user action.
