### Why is this important?

The HTML5 `<canvas>` element can be used to create a canvas area on the page where an author can draw to or include graphic elements. However, canvas content is not exposed to assistive technologies like semantic HTML. To make a `<canvas>` element accessible, any image content must be described in text, and interactive content must be made available in canvas fallback content that has keyboard access.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * If the same functionality can be achieved using native HTML elements, do not use the `<canvas>` element;
 * **Or**, if the `<canvas>` element contains a simple drawing, provide a `role="img"` on the `<canvas>` element with a label. If the label is not sufficient to make the drawing accessible, also provide a description (`aria-describedby="foo"`);
 * **Or**, if the `<canvas>` element is more complex such as a static chart, or an interactive drawing, provide an alternative accessible rendering;
 * **Or**, use canvas fallback content (between the `<canvas>` tags) with keyboard access.

This example shows the use of the `<canvas>` element with its content exposed as an image with a ARIA `role` attribute, a label, and a description.

```
<!-- Canvas exposed as an image element. -->
<canvas id="example" role="img" alt="Circles" aria-describedby="img1"></canvas>
<div id="img1">
    <p>The prose in this div describes the circles in detail</p>
</div>
```

This example shows an interactive `<canvas>` with equivalent accessible information provided in the canvas fallback content. The keyboard equivalent would be applied to the corresponding fallback elements.

```
<!-- Canvas exposed as a button element -->
<canvas id="roundButton" onmousedown="..." onmouseup="..." onclick="..." onkeydown="..." onkeyup="...">
    <div tabindex="0" role="button">ok</div>
</canvas>
```

                <!-- This is where the rule id is injected -->
                <div id="ruleInfo"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="bx--col-sm-4 bx--col-md-3 bx--col-lg-4 toolSide">
