### Why is this important?

Elements (component containers) use the `aria-activedescendant` property to manage the focus of their active descendants.
Assistive technologies do not require the developer to manipulate the `tabindex` attribute among [focusable elements within the container](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_focus_activedescendant).
Instead, only the container element needs to be included in the tab sequence.

Setting the `tabindex` value to `"0"` or greater ensures the element will be included in the tab sequence and allows its descendants to receive focus for keyboard access.
The `tabindex` value defines the order (sequence) in which elements will receive focus when users navigate via the keyboard:
* `"-1"` will remove the element from the tab sequence (ignored during tabbing) but may remain focusable
* `"0"` will be handled in the order (tab sequence) as it appears in the DOM source code order
* `">0"` (positive number) [creates a relative ordering](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-tabindex-attribute) that starts from the element(s) with the lowest value (e.g. 1) and then proceeds to the element(s) with the next higher value

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Set the value of the `tabindex` attribute equal to `"0"` or greater on the element using the `aria-activedescendant` property to include the element in the tab sequence
* Ensure the tab sequence is in a logical order and the component is keyboard operable

 The following example shows a toolbar element using the `aria-activedescendant` property with a `tabindex` attribute set to zero:

```
<div role="toolbar" aria-label="Toolbar Widget" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button2" id="tb3" onkeypress="keyEvent();">
    <div id="button1" role="button1">tool 1</div>
    <div id="button2" role="button2">tool 2</div>
</div>
```

            <div class="bx--col-sm-4 bx--col-md-3 bx--col-lg-4 toolSide">
