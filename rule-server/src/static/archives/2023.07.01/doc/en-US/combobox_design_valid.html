### Why is this important?

A combobox combines a text input element and a popup element that helps the user set the value of the
input. The text input element must be a single line text field with an appropriate role, otherwise 
assistive technologies may not be able to present and control the content correctly. 

The ARIA 1.1 combobox pattern was not supported by browsers. The ARIA 1.2 pattern is best
supported by browsers and assistive technologies.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Code the combobox as in the [ARIA practices - Examples](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#examples-1)
