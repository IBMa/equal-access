### Why is this important?

Browsers and assistive technology must be able to accurately interpret the markup of the content.
If the code is ambiguous or incorrect, then it may be interpreted differently by browsers and assistive technology and the content will not be accessible to users.

As technology evolves, 
sometimes new ways to meet a use case become available, that work better than a feature that was previously defined in a specification.
When specifications are updated, some roles and attributes become "deprecated" because of existing implementations of the older feature.
This indicates that the feature is allowed and expected to be supported by conforming browsers.
However, those deprecated features may soon become obsolete, will be removed in future specifications,
and will no longer be expected to be supported by browsers and assistive technology used by persons with disabilities.
So, it is prudent to update the code to avoid deprecated features. 

For example, 
in [ARIA 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#deprecated) the `role=directory` is being deprecated,
and the `aria-disabled` state is being deprecated as a global state. 

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Replace deprecated roles and attributes with those preferred in the current version of the specification.

                <!-- This is where the rule id is injected -->

            <div class="bx--col-sm-4 bx--col-md-3 bx--col-lg-4 toolSide">

* [ARIA 1.2 - Deprecated Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#deprecated)

### Who does this affect?

* People using assistive technologies that expose accessibility information
