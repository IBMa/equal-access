### Why is this important?

Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier and a severe distraction to anyone who has trouble reading stationary text quickly as well as anyone who has trouble tracking moving objects. The `<marquee>` element is obsolete and should not be used.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If it isn't absolutely necessary, don't use this effect;
* **Or**, use other options such as CSS or scripting to create the same effect, and include an option to turn off the scrolling.
