### Why is this important?

People with disabilities often navigate content without a mouse, using the tab key or other key commands to move around the page. When there is repeating information between related pages, it is tedious to tab through these to get to other areas of the page. When repeated content is organized into logical groups that can be easily skipped, navigation becomes much more efficient.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Provide headings for each content section using `<h1>` ... `<h6>`;
* **And/or** provide landmarks to identify blocks of content on the page;
* **And/or** use links to skip blocks of repeated content by linking from the top of the page to the main content, or from the start of the repeated content to the end of the block;
* **And/or** group blocks of repeated content using structural elements (e.g. `<map>`, `<ul>` or `<ol>`), or `<frame>` elements with a `"title"` attribute, or an expandable and collapsible menu.
