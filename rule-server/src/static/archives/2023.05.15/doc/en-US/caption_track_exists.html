### Why is this important?

Text tracks or open captions contain a textual transcription of audio aspects of video content in a synchronized media. This may include the dialog, sound effects, and relevant musical cues. Providing text alternatives (captions) makes information available that some people would not have access to otherwise.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If the video has any meaningful audio and no captions, then provide closed captions using the `<track>` element;
* **Or**, make sure the recorded video has open captions. Closed captions, which can be controlled by the user, are preferred.
* **Or**, make sure the surrounding text provides the equivalent information that is in the recorded video, and label the video as a media alternative

For example:

```
<video src="...">
      <track src="myvideo.srt" kind="captions" >
</video>
```
