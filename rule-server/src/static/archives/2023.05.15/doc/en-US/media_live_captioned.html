### Why is this important?

Providing captions for real-time presentations enables viewers to understand the audio content when they cannot hear it, or the sound is off.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify that the live media has closed captions (embeds the dialogue and important sounds as text in a way that is not visible unless the user requests it);
 * **Or**, verify that the live media has open captions (embeds the dialogue and important sounds as text in the video track);
 * **Or**, add captions to the live media.
