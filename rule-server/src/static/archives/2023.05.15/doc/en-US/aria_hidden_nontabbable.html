### Why is this important?

Using either `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on a focusable element will result in some users focusing on "nothing".
A focusable element with `aria-hidden="true"` is ignored as part of the reading order, 
but still part of the focus order, 
making its state of visible or hidden unclear.
This rule checks that elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute do not contain focusable elements.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

When designers and developers want to hide parts of a web page that are pure decoration, 
such as icon fonts - that are not meant to be read by assistive technologies:

* ensure that assistive technologies will ignore the element by adding `aria-hidden="true"` to the element
* enure none of the target elements are part of sequential focus navigation
* ensure no descendants are part of sequential focus navigation 

### Example

* In the following example, the `button` element is focusable by default. 
Therefore, using `aria-hidden="true"` violates the rule: 
```
        <div aria-hidden="true">
            <div aria-hidden="false">
                <button>Some button</button>
            </div>
        </div>
```

Note: Using `aria-hidden="false"` on a descendant of an element with `aria-hidden="true"` does not expose that element.
Using `aria-hidden="true"` hides itself and all its content from assistive technologies.
