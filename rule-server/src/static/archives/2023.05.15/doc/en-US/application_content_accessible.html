### Why is this important?

Within an element with the role `"application"`, only focusable elements are accessible to users of some assistive technologies by default. Therefore, to ensure access to any non-decorative static text or image content that does not receive focus by default, it must be implemented in an accessible way.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Verify that the content is decorative;
* **Or**, associate the content with a focusable element using the `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute;
* **Or**, place the content in a focusable element that has role `"document"` or `"article"`;
* **Or**, manage the focus of descendants as described in [Managing Focus](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#managingfocus) by updating the value of `aria-activedescendant` to reference the element containing the focused content.
