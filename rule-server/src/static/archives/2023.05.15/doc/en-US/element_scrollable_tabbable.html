### Why is this important?

Many users need to be able to use the keyboard and keyboard-like emulators to navigate to and operate scrollable elements – such as scrolling up-down and left-right with arrow keys – to reveal all the visible content. 
Only some browsers (e.g. Firefox) will automatically include _**any**_ scrollable element in the tab-order (tabbable sequence) to ensure keyboard accessibility. 
Browsers will automatically make scrollable elements tabbable when they _**contain**_ tabbable elements (e.g. buttons) without requiring an explicit `tabindex`attribute on the container element. 
However, setting the `tabindex` attribute on a scrollable container itself to a negative value excludes it and its tabbable content from the tab-order, 
effectively making it keyboard inaccessible and blocking many users.

Note: this rule is not applicable to purely decorative content and whitespace. 
Although occasionally this rule may fail scrollable elements with alternate scroll controls such as through a button or customer scrollbar, 
it’s strongly recommended that developers still include the standard arrow key behavior that users expect. 

<!-- the "detected element" and the "unallowed semantics" will be displayed in the rule message above, so the “Why important” paragraph assumes the reader will understand it in context -->

<!-- This is where the code snippet that triggered the rule is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Ensure scrollable elements that contain visible non-tabbable elements are not excluded from the tab-order by adding a `tabindex` attribute value greater than or equal to `”0”` to the container element
* **Or**, if the scrollable element contains tabbable content, ensure that container element does not have a negative `tabindex` that effectively removes the scrollable element from the tab-order

Example of a keyboard scrollable element:
```
<div style="height: 50px; width: 300px; overflow: scroll;" tabindex="0">
	<h2>Important but lengthy content</h2>
        <p>This is important content that the designer decided to make scrollable and not always display **all* the content at the same time when the area is restricted in a relatively small space. 
        When scrollbars appear, the developer needs to ensure the element will be scrollable via the arrow keys.</p>
	<p>Lorem ipsum… but no buttons, links, or other tabbable content are included in this example, so a `tabindex` is required.</p>
</div>
```
