### Why is this important?

A combobox is a UI interactive component that combines an input and another element, such as a listbox
or grid, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set the value of the input. When a combobox 
receives focus, the focus should be set on the text `<input>` element. Unless using a dialog
popup, the `aria-activedescendant` must be used to identify the currently focused selection in the
popup, so people who use assistive technologies are able to accurately navigate and interact with the content.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Unless the `aria-haspopup` attribute value is `"dialog"`, set the active descendant focus using the `aria-activedescendant` attribute only on the combobox’s `<input>` element.

Alert: The guidance for combobox is changing significantly in ARIA 1.2 due to problems with implementation of the ARIA 1.1 pattern. The recommended combobox pattern for ARIA 1.2 is:

```
<label for="tag_combo">Tag</label>
  <input type="text" id="tag_combo"
      role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
      aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
      aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="selected_option">
   <ul role="listbox" id="popup_listbox">
      <li role="option">Zebra</li>
      <li role="option" id="selected_option">Zoom</li>
   </ul>
```
