### Why is this important?

Many users need to be able to use the keyboard and keyboard-like emulators to navigate to and interact with content and web applications even within any `<iframe>` elements. 
Setting the `tabindex` attribute on an `<iframe>` element to a negative value excludes its content from the tab-order. 
For example, a `button` should be in the tab-order within an `iframe`, 
but if the `<iframe>` itself is taken out of the tab-order, 
the `button` is removed from the tab-order and effectively is keyboard inaccessible and blocks some users.

<!-- the "detected element" and the "unallowed semantics" will be displayed in the rule message above, so the "Why important" paragraph assumes the reader will understand it in context -->

<!-- This is where the code snippet that triggered the rule is injected -->

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Ensure visible interactive elements are not excluded from the tab-order by adding a `tabindex` attribute value greater than or equal to `"0"` to  the `<iframe>` element
* **Or**, if not intended to be interactable, remove or hide the content from within the `<iframe>` element

Example of a tabbable `<iframe>`:
```
<iframe title="Inline example" srcdoc="<a href="http://xyz">link text</a>" tabindex="0" />
```
