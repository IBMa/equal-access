### Why is this important?

A keyboard-focusable (tabbable) element has been found with an invalid role.
When users reach elements by tabbing with the keyboard, 
the element's role provides context about the expected interaction, 
and assistive technologies like screen readers can provide additional information about ways to interact. 
The only elements that should be in the tab order should be operable widgets. 
Inoperable elements, such as headings, can be given focus by developers; however, they should not be tabbable by the user.

It's likely that either a non-interactive element was given a `tabindex` value of 0 or greater, or assigned an element’s role incorrectly. 
The Checker detects implied roles of interactive HTML elements that automatically get keyboard focus. 
The Checker also detects content blocks that get keyboard focus to enable scrolling of the area using arrow keys when coding CSS `overflow: scroll` or `overflow: auto`. 
Both of these situations are valid. 
However, if the element *should not* be operable with the keyboard, then it *should not* be tabbable and get keyboard focus. 

Note: IBM considers this a _violation_ of WCAG Success Criteria. 
Others may use a strict interpretation of the criterion and may only _recommend_ this to be fixed. 
However, there is broad agreement that putting inoperable elements in the tab order has an accessibility impact on users.

### What to do

- If users *should not* be able to interact with this element using the keyboard, replace the non-widget role, 
*and/or* use the explicit `tabindex="-1"` attribute to remove the element from the keyboard focus (tab) order.
- *Or*,if users *should* be able to interact with this element using the keyboard, use a valid widget role

### Examples:

This first example is a simple focusable *toggle button*. 
(JavaScript and CSS would need to be added to provide the appearance and full button functionality):

```
<div id="saveChanges" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-pressed="false">Save</div>
```

The second example is placed in the tab order automatically and provides features by default when using the HTML `<button>` element of `type=”button”` that informs the user about its intended interaction: 

```
<button type="button" id="saveChanges">Save</button>
```

The third example shows how a block of text can get keyboard focus to enable scrolling of the area by specifying `overflow: scroll` in the CSS: 

```
<style> 
div.scroll { width: 200px; height: 100px; border: 2px solid black; overflow: scroll;} 
</style> 
... 
<div class="scroll" tabindex="0">You can use the CSS overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. 
The overflow property specifies horizontal and vertical scroll bars operable with arrow keys if content overflows an element's box.</div> 
```
