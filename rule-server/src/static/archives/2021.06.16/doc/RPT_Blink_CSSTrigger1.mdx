### Check the `blink` value of the CSS `text-decoration` property is not used for more than than five seconds

### Why is this important?

Blinking content can be a severe distraction, preventing some people from attending to other content. Blinking for up to 5 seconds gives time to get a user's attention, but is short enough for them to wait out the distraction before reading the page.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Do not use the `blink` value on the CSS `text-decoration` property;
 * OR, provide a control on the Web page that allows users to stop the blinking;
 * OR, use scripts to stop the blinking after 5 seconds.
