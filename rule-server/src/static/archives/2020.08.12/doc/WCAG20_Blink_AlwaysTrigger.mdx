### Who does this affect?

* People with attention deficit disorders
* People with reading disabilities
* People with intellectual disabilities
* People with low vision

### Why is this important?

The text inside a `blink` element can blink at a predetermined rate as there is no way to interrupt or disable blinking. Although blinking draws attention to content, it can be a problem for some users if it persists and may make it difficult or impossible to interact with the rest of the page. The use of the `blink` element has been deprecated.

### Content found that blinks persistently
Content that blinks persistently must not be used

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If there is a need to include blinking content, use a technology that stops blinking in 5 seconds or less;
* OR, provide an option to turn off blinking;
* OR, provide a link to an alternative page without the blinking content.
