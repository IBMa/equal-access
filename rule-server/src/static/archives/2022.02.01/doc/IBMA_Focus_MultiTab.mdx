### The component has more than one tabbable element

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The component must have no more than one tabbable element

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

The primary keyboard navigation convention uses Tab and `Shift+Tab` key commands to move focus from one UI component to another. Other keys (primarily the arrow keys) move focus within components comprised of multiple focusable elements. Authors must follow this convention and provide no more than one tab stop per component (providing keyboard focus).

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do
* Modify the widgetâ€™s keyboard navigation model to contain only one tab stop to set focus in or on the widget. 
(Refer to the [ARIA practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#keyboard) for more information on how to manage keyboard focus.)
