import "../../../styles/ToolHelp.scss"
import { CodeSnippet, Tag } from "carbon-components-react";

<div className="toolHelp">
<Row>
<Column colLg={16} colMd={8} colSm={4} className="toolHead">

### The component does not have a tabbable element

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The component must have at least one tabbable element

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA - authors must incorporate the code for keyboard access.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

Use the HTML tabindex attribute to include the component in the tab sequence.
(Refer to the [ARIA practices - Developing a Keyboard Interface](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#keyboard) for more information on how to manage keyboard focus.)
