### List element is missing or improperly structured

<div id="locLevel"></div>

List elements should only be used for lists of related items

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Lists add structural information that helps users navigate without vision. Using list markup improperly hinders accessibility by making it difficult for users with specialized software to understand the organization of the page or to navigate through it.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Check that list items are represented with `<li>` elements and enclosed within list elements `<ul>` or `<ol>`;
 * **And**, check that definition list items are represented with `<dt>`, or `<di>` and enclosed within a definition list element `<dl>`;
 * **And**, check that elements within a list element do form a list.
