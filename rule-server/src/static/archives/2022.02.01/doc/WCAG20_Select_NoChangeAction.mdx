### Verify that no change of context occurs when selection options in this component receive focus

<div id="locLevel"></div>

No changes of context should occur when a selection value receives focus

</Column>
</Row>

<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When using the `<select>` element, the user should be allowed to control when an action is performed, rather than having an action occur as a side effect of choosing a value. This mechanism provides the user with an opportunity to inspect the different values of the `<select>` element, or to correct a choice. When the user is satisfied with their choice, they can select a button to perform the action. This interaction is particularly important for users who are choosing the value of the `<select>` element via the keyboard, because navigating through the options of the `<select>` element changes the value of the control and would otherwise submit the value after seeing only the first option.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Use the keyboard to navigate to and within the `<select>` component;
 * **And**, verify that when each selection option receives focus, no [change of context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-focus.html#dfn-changes-of-context) is triggered.
