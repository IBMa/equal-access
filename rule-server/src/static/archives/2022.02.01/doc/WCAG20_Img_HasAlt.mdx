### Image does not have a short text alternative

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Images that convey meaning must have a short text alternative

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When an image contains important information, providing a text alternative makes the same information accessible through audio or other channels.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If the image conveys meaning, use the `alt` attribute on the `<img>` element to provide a short description that serves the same purpose as the image. If the image contains important words, include them in the short description (e.g. `<img alt="submit">`);
* **Or**, if the image is decorative or redundant, use the `alt` attribute with an empty string as its value (e.g. `<img alt="">`).
