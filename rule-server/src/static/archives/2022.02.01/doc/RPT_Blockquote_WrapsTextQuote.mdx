<Column colLg={16} colMd={8} colSm={4} className="toolHead">

### If the following text is a quotation, mark it as a `<q>` or `<blockquote>` element: "{0}"

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Quotations should be marked with `<q>` or `<blockquote>` elements

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

The HTML `<q>` and `<blockquote>` elements tell assistive technologies such as screen readers which content is part of a quotation or citation. Any such text must be included in the appropriate element that enables assistive technology users to understand its meaning and purpose.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify the text is not a quotation;
 * **Or**, if the quotation is 10 words or less, enclose it in a `<q>` element;
 * **Or**, for a longer quotation, enclose it in a `<blockquote>` element.

For example:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>&lt;p&gt;As she walked up she said, &lt;q&gt;Hi, my name is Natasha.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Quotation from &lt;cite="https://www.shakespeare.com/loveslabourlost"&gt;Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Painfully to pore upon a book
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</CodeSnippet>

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
