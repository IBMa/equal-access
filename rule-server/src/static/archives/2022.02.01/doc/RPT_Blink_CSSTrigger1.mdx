### Why is this important?

Blinking content can be a severe distraction, preventing some people from attending to other content. Blinking for up to 5 seconds gives time to get a user's attention, but is short enough for them to wait out the distraction before reading the page.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Do not use the `blink` value on the CSS `text-decoration` property;
 * **Or**, provide a control on the Web page that allows users to stop the blinking;
 * **Or**, use scripts to stop the blinking after 5 seconds.
