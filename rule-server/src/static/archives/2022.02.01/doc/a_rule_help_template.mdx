### The active message goes here _without tokens_ but with `'backticks for formating code'` and tokens __cannot__ be used in mdx

<!-- This active message title is NOT used by the Checker, 
the browser extension uses the active messages: Fail_ or Potential_ message in ...nls/index.ts file instead -->

<!-- the Checker browser extension displays the rule level, such as Violation, Needs Review, or Recommendation here -->

This is the passive message that will show up in reports, with `backticks for formating code` but tokens **cannot** be used in mdx 

<!-- Checker does not display this message sub-title, 
the browser extension displays the 0: message in  ...nls/index.ts file -->

<!-- Note that the messages in the test files must also match 
the messages from the ...nls/index.ts file instead of message titles here in mdx -->

### Why is this important?

PLACEHOLDER TEXT HERE SHOULD BE REPLACED BEFORE MERGE TO MASTER ... such as This example text with `role="combobox"`, an `<element>` with values of `"listbox"`, `"tree"`, `"grid"`, or `"dialog"`.
If the value for the `'aria-haspopup'` attribute does not match the value for the popup element's `'role'` 
attribute, people who use assistive technologies may see unexpected behavior and will not know how 
to interact with the content.


<div id="locSnippet"></div>


### What to do

* PLACEHOLDER TEXT HERE SHOULD BE REPLACED BEFORE MERGE TO MASTER ... such as Set the value of the `'aria-haspopup'` attribute of the `<combobox>` element to match the value of the `'role'` attribute of the implemented popup.
* Allowed `<SupportedElementNameHere>` element with `'role'` attribute values of `"listbox"`, `"tree"`, `"grid"`, or `"dialog"`.
* **Or**, and another explanation of what to do.

Alert: MORE TEXT HERE IF APPROPRIATE. The recommended code example is:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}> &lt;label for="tag_combo"&gt;Tag&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="tag_combo"
      role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
      aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
      aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="selected_option"&gt;
   &lt;ul role="listbox" id="popup_listbox"&gt;
      &lt;li role="option"&gt;Zebra&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role="option" id="selected_option"&gt;Zoom&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;</CodeSnippet>
