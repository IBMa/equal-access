<Row>
<Column colLg={16} colMd={8} colSm={4} className="toolHead">

### File name used to describe an image

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Check the `"alt"` attribute value is a good alternative for the image

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When an image contains important information that is not available in text on the page, providing a text alternative makes the same information accessible through audio or other channels.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If the image conveys meaning, the value of the `"alt"` attribute should be a short description that serves the same purpose as the image. Include any important words from the image in the short description (e.g. `<img alt="submit">`). Do not use a file name;
* **Or**, if the image is decorative or the same information is also available in text, use the `"alt"` attribute with an empty string as its value (e.g.  `<img alt="">`).
