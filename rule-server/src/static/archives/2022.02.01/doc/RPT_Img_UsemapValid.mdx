### Server-side image map hot-spots do not have text links

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Server-side image map hot-spots must have text links

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Server-side image maps are images in which regions of the image contain "hot-spots" where a user can click to follow a link. Because the actual links are stored on the server, the browser cannot provide information about the links to a user who cannot see the graphics.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Use the `<a>` element with `"href"` attribute to provide text links corresponding to all hot-spots for the server-side image map on the page.
