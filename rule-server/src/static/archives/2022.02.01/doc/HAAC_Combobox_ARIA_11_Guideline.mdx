### Check combobox component is coded to ARIA 1.2 Authoring Practices

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Combobox widget should be coded to ARIA 1.2 Authoring Practices

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

The features and behaviors of combobox implementations are complex and vary widely, so it is important that the recommended authoring techniques are followed to produce a fully functioning component. This ensures full keyboard control, focus management and manipulation of the roles, states, and properties. These in turn support assistive technology and provide necessary information to interact with the component.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Confirm the element with `combobox` role follows a supported design pattern as described in [ARIA practices - Combobox](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#combobox);
* **And**, perform a manual test to ensure the keyboard interaction, focus management and manipulation of the roles, states, and properties work as intended.

Alert: The guidance for combobox is changing significantly in ARIA 1.2 due to problems with implementation of the ARIA 1.1 pattern. The recommended combobox pattern for ARIA 1.2 is:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}> &lt;label for="tag_combo"&gt;Tag&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="tag_combo"
      role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
      aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
      aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="selected_option"&gt;
&lt;ul role="listbox" id="popup_listbox"&gt;
   &lt;li role="option"&gt;Zebra&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li role="option" id="selected_option"&gt;Zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</CodeSnippet>
