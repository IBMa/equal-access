### Verify `<frame>` content is accessible

<div id="locLevel"></div>

A `<frame>` containing non-HTML content must be made accessible

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

If the content of a `<frame>` is not HTML, it may not be accessible. For example, if the source of the `<frame>` element is an image file, assistive technology cannot read the content because you cannot add `alt` text to the image in the `<frame>` source. The user opens the frame and hears nothing or perhaps the name of the image file. The `<frame>` element is obsolete and ideally should not be used. When used, the frame source must be accessible.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * HTML `<frame>` is obsolete, if possible avoid its use;
 * OR, verify that interactive content inside the frame is accessible by keyboard;
 * AND, verify that content inside the frame can be accessed by assistive technologies such as a screen reader.
