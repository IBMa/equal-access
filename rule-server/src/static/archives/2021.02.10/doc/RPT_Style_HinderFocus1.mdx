### Check the keyboard focus indicator is highly visible when using CSS elements for border or outline

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The keyboard focus indicator must be highly visible when default border or outline is modified by CSS

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

All focus indicators should be highly visible and distinguishable. When navigating a Web page with a keyboard, users need to know which element has the keyboard focus. A visual focus indicator might be a vertical bar (a typical cursor) or a visible border surrounding a user interface control.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * If the keyboard focus meets visibility standards when tabbing on to the component, no action is needed;
 * OR, use the default focus indicator for the platform;
 * OR, adjust the CSS styling to make the keyboard focus highly visible;
 * OR, use interface components that are highlighted by the user agent when they receive focus;
 * OR, use a script to change the background color or border of the element to make it visually distinct when it receives focus
