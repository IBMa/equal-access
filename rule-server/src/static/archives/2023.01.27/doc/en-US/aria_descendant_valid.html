### Why is this important?

Correct roles and descendants help ensure that assistive technologies can gather the correct information about all the user interface components. 
When certain elements that are specified in ARIA to have presentational descendants, browsers _should not_ expose the descendants through the platform accessibility API to assistive technologies. 
If user agents do not hide the descendants contents and semantics from the accessibility tree, some information may be presented (spoken) twice and confuse the end user. 
The content contained by the element, i.e., inner text, as well as contents of all its descendants remain visible to assistive technologies, 
except, of course, when the text is explicitly hidden, e.g., styled with `display:none` or has `aria-hidden="true"`.

This rule is triggered when one of the following elements contain more than presentational descendants: `button`, `checkbox`, `img`, `math`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `option`, `progressbar`, `radio`, `scrollbar`, `separator`, `slider`, `switch`, and `tab`. 
Refer to the table in [ARIA in HTML - Allowed descendants of ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-descendants-of-aria-roles) for the normative definition for each ARIA role, 
the kinds of content categories for each role, and what [kinds of elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#kinds-of-content) can be descendants.

For example, a `<button>` allows text and images, 
but does not allow [interactive content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#interactive-content-2) or descendants with a tabindex attribute because that would confuse assistive technology users as to the expected content or behavior of the button.
