# equal-access

This Git repository hosts tools and supporting components that are part of the [IBM Equal Access Toolkit](https://ibm.com/able/toolkit).

## Overview

This README covers topics for users who want to find the deployed tools as well as topics for developers who want to better understand the various components and build the tools.

The [wiki](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/wiki) contains overview information, links to videos, and other resources.

## Usage

The tools have been deployed to the various stores and NPM so they can be easily downloaded and installed:

* [Chrome accessibility-checker-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibm-equal-access-accessib/lkcagbfjnkomcinoddgooolagloogehp) : web browser extension that integrates automated accessibility checking capabilities into the Chrome Developer Tools

* [Node accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker): automated accessibility testing within a continuous integration pipeline such as Travis CI for Node-based test environments such as Selenium, Puppeteer, Playwright, and Zombie; the ability to validate results against baseline files, and scan local files
* [karma-accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-accessibility-checker): automated accessibility testing for the Karma environment
* [cypress-accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-accessibility-checker): wrapper of the `accessibility-checker` in the Cypress environment
