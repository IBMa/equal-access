# cucumber-selenium

This boilerplate shows how cucumber-selenium WebDriver browser can be used to automate accessibility testing in your pipeline and the results saved.

Scanning a set of test cases in a repeatable fashion is a level of automation beyond using the command-line to scan a list of URLs (static pages) or using the browser's DevTools extension to manually scan, manually interact with pages, and store a multi-scan report:
- See [Extensions](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/wiki#extensions) for the list of browser extensions supported to interactively scan multiple pages, states, and store a multi-scan report.
- See [Command-Line multi-scan](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/wiki#scanning-multiple-pages) for information about one-time scanning a list of files, directories, or a list of URLs generated from a web crawler.
