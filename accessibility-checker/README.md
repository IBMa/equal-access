# accessibility-checker NODE

Automated accessibility testing for Node-based test environments.

To get started using the deployed packages, review [Node accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) on NPM.

## Features

- Scan single or multiple files, directories, or URLs
- Output scan results in JSON, CSV, HTML or XLSX formats
- Automate accessibility testing within a continuous integration pipeline such as Travis CI
- Integrate with Node-based test environments such as Selenium, Puppeteer, Playwright, Jest, and Zombie
- Validate test results against baselines
- Set a target rule archive
- Configure policies (rule sets) to scan
- Set violation levels that trigger test failures
- Set violation levels that should be reported

## Command-line and multi-scan

This module provides some basic command-line utilities that will allow scanning files, directories, and URLs:

- Create a .txt file with path(s) to files, directories, or a list of URLs to be scanned
- Provide the `npx achecker` the full path of the .txt file to start the scan (e.g. `npx achecker path/to/your/file.txt`)
- Run `npx achecker`

Review the [accessibility-checker/src/README](src/README.md) for more information.

## Boilerplates

- [cucumber-selenium](cucumber-selenium): Using [Cucumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cucumber) with a [Selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) browser
- [jest](jest): Using a [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) test environment
- [jest-selenium](jest-selenium): Using a [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) test environment with a [Selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) browser
- [mocha-selenium](mocha-selenium): Using a [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) test environment with a [Selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) browser
- [mocha-zombie](mocha-zombie): Using a [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) test environment with a [Zombie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zombie) browser simulator
- [protractor](protractor): Using a [Protractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor) test environment
- and others

## Baselines

Baselines are a helpful feature of `accessibility-checker` that can also be used in the test environment. The concept involves capturing a scan result as a 'baseline' so that future scans will pass if they match the baseline. If they differ, then the test will fail. This feature is useful for issues that have been determined to be the following:

- false positives
- issues scheduled to be fixed later
- capturing new regression issues

See the [accessibility-checker/src/README](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/blob/master/accessibility-checker/src/README.md) for details.
Review the examples of validating automated accessibility testing results against baseline files:

- [jest baselines](jest/baselines)
- [jest-selenium baselines](jest-selenium/baselines)
- [mocha-zombie baselines](mocha-zombie/baselines)
- and others

## Building and running locally

```

## Known issues and workarounds

1. If you see `TypeError: ace.Checker is not a constructor`: 
    - Try to run your tests serially using the configuration option in your framework. For example, use `--runInBand` in Jest framework. 

2. If your site has a `Content Security Policy`, the engine script may be
    prevented from loading. In the browser console, you'll see something like:
    > VM43:24 Refused to load the script ‘https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/accessibility-checker-engine@3.1.42/ace.js’ because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive:

    If you would prefer not to add cdn.jsdelivr.net to the CSP, you can add able.ibm.com instead via your config file (e.g., ruleServer: "https://able.ibm.com/rules")

## Feedback and reporting bugs
