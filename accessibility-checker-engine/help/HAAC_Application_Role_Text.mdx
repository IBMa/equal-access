## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with low vision who have trouble finding or tracking a pointer indicator on the screen
* People who physically cannot use a pointing device

## Why is this important?

Within an element with the role `"application"`, only focusable elements are accessible to users of some assistive technologies by default. Therefore, to ensure access to any non-decorative static text or image content that does not receive focus by default, it must be implemented in an accessible way.

## What to do

* Verify that the content is decorative;
* OR, associate the content with a focusable element using the `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute;
* OR, place the content in a focusable element that has role `"document"` or `"article"`;
* OR, manage the focus of descendants as described in [Managing Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#managingfocus) by updating the value of `aria-activedescendant` to reference the element containing the focused content.
