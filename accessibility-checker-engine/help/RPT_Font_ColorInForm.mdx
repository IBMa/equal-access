### Check color is not used as the only visual means to convey the fields are required

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Combine color and descriptive markup to convey fields are required

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Using descriptive markup and visual differences together with color enables users who cannot see color to understand the meaning conveyed through color differences.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If color is used to indicate required fields, also use the `required` attribute and an asterisk ('*') with text (e.g.  “required fields are red") to indicate required fields both programmatically and visually without color;

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
