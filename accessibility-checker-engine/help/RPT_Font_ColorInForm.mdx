## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with visual impairment using color contrast enhancement
* People who cannot see color, have limited color vision or have color blindness
* People using text-based browsers (e.g., Lynx) or audio interfaces

## Why is this important?

Using descriptive markup and visual differences together with color enables users who cannot see color to understand the meaning conveyed through color differences.

<div id="locLevel" className="level-violation">Needs review</div>

## Check color is not used as the only visual means to convey the fields are required
Combine color and descriptive markup to convey fields are required

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* If color is used to indicate required fields, also use the `required` attribute and an asterisk ('*') with text (e.g.  â€œrequired fields are red") to indicate required fields both programmatically and visually without color;
