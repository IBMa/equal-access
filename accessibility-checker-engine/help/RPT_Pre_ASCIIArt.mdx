## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using a screen reader
* People using text-based browsers (e.g., Lynx) or audio interfaces

## Why is this important?

ASCII art cannot be read out by assistive technologies. Providing a text alternative makes the information available in a non-visual format. A link to skip the ASCII art saves users from having to read through large quantities of seemingly nonsense characters.

## Check whether ASCII art has a text alternative
ASCII art must have a text alternative

[IBM 1.1.1 Non-text content](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/non_text_content.html) | [WCAG technique H86](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H86)

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

 * If this element is not ASCII art but meaningful text, no action is needed;
 * OR, if this is ASCII art, verify there is a text alternative immediately before or after it. A link to skip the ASCII art is also recommended.
