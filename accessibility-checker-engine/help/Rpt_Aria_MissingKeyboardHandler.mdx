## Who does this affect?

 * Blind people using screen readers
 * People with low vision
 * People with tremor or other movement disorders
 * People who rely on keyboard control

## Why is this important?

Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with WAI-ARIA. Authors need to implement keyboard access using keyboard handlers such as `onkeydown` or `onkeypress`.

## Interactive WAI_ARIA UI component does not have keyboard handlers implemented for keyboard access
Interactive WAI_ARIA UI components must provide keyboard access

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

 * Confirm you can use only the keyboard to navigate to and interact with the UI component;
 * OR, if the component is not keyboard accessible, implement `onkeydown` or `onkeypress` keyboard handlers on the element itself using the [ARIA 1.2 Authoring practices guidance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2);
 * OR, if the inaccessible component has required children, implement `onkeydown` or `onkeypress` keyboard handlers on all the required children (example below) or a grandchild of each required child;
 * OR, use other methods to provide keyboard access as described in [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2, Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#aria_ex).

For example:

```
<div role="tree" id="tree1">
    <div id="item1" role="treeitem" tabindex="0" onkeypress="keyEvent()">Tree item</div>
</div>
```

</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
