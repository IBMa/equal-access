## Who does this affect?

* People with moderately low vision who do not use a contrast-enhancing technology 
* People who do not see the full range of colors 
* People who see no color. 

## Why is this important?

When the foreground text and its background colors have less than a 4.5:1 contrast ratio it can be difficult for people with moderately low vision to read the text without a contrast-enhancing technology.

## Verify that image layers or color gradients do not reduce the text contrast (calculated at {0}) below WCAG 2.1 AA requirements for text of size {1}px and weight of {2}
The contrast ratio of text and the background (i.e. background with a color gradient or a background image) must meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirementsÂ

## What to do

* Text should always have a solid background (i.e. not a color gradient or a background image) where possible;
* OR when that is not possible (which is very rare), manually check the contrast ratio of the text against the lightest and the darkest colors of the background with a Color Contrast Analyzer. For large text at least 18 point or at least 14 point when bold, the contrast ratio must be at least 3:1. For smaller text, it should be at least 4.5:1. If less, adjust the colors.
