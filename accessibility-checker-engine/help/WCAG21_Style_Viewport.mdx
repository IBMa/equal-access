## Who does this affect?

* People with low vision using screen magnification

## Why is this important?

To support people with low vision, any visually rendered text must scale up to 200% of the default content size, without loss of content or functionality and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions. When viewport units are applied to text (generally via font-size in CSS), they are relative to the viewport and this does not allow for text resize by browser zooming or adjusting text-size.
