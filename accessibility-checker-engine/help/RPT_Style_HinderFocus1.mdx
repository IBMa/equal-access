## Who does this affect?

 * Blind people using screen readers
 * People who physically cannot use a pointing device

## Why is this important?

All focus indicators should be highly visible and distinguishable. When navigating a Web page with a keyboard, users need to know which element has the keyboard focus. A visual focus indicator might be a vertical bar (a typical cursor) or a visible border surrounding a user interface control.

## What to do

 * If the keyboard focus meets visibility standards when tabbing on to the component, no action is needed;
 * OR, use the default focus indicator for the platform;
 * OR, adjust the CSS styling to make the keyboard focus highly visible;
 * OR, use interface components that are highlighted by the user agent when they receive focus;
 * OR, use a script to change the background color or border of the element to make it visually distinct when it receives focus
