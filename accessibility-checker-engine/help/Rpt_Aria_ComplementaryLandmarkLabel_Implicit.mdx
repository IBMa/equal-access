* Blind people using screen readers

## Why is this important?

Elements with a `"complementary"` role are a type of region used to enclose content that is complementary to the main content on the page. Providing a visible label for each `"complementary"` region on the page provides better context for all users including people using assistive technologies. These landmark labels help to identify and navigate to the content.

<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

<div id="locLevel"></div>

## An element with a `"complementary"` role does not have a visible label
A unique and visible label is preferred for each element with a `"complementary"` role

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* For each `<aside>` element or element with `role="complementary"`, set the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute to the `id` value of any visible text that appropriately and uniquely describes the complementary content.

For example:

```
<h1 id="weather">Weather portlet</h1>

<div role="complementary" aria-labelledby="weather">
...
</div>
```


</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
