## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with low vision using screen magnification
* People with dexterity impairment using voice control

## Why is this important?
Interactive UI components with certain implicit or explicit WAI-ARIA roles require an [accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-accessible-name). Without proper labels or the programmatically associated name, assistive technologies may not be able to accurately present the component's name and purpose to the user. This affects the userâ€™s navigation and ability to interact with the content.

## Interactive component does not have a programatically associated name

## What to do

* Use the `aria-labelledby` attribute to reference existing visible text on the page that can clearly identify the purpose of the component;
* OR use the `aria-label` attribute with a short description as its value that can clearly dentify the purpose of the component when a visual label is not available;
* OR use the `title` attribute to provide a name when the design cannot accommodate a visual label;
* OR if the element's role allows it to derive a label from its content, provide the label text as the inner content of the element (e.g. `<button type="submit">Search</button>`).

The following code snippet shows a tree widget labelled with an `aria-labelledby` attribute to reference the heading text:

   ```<h1 id="contents">Table of contents</h1>
   <div role="tree" aria-labelledby="contents" tabindex="0">...</div>
   ```
