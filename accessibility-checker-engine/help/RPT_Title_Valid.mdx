## Why is this important?

Descriptive titles help users find relevant content and navigate through it. The `<title>` element labels your page. It is typically the first part of the page that users see (or hear), and it allows them to differentiate your page from others.  Browsers put the title in the title bar of the page window where it is quickly accessible, and automated tools such as search engines use the title to index and classify the page.

## Provide a descriptive `<title>` for Web pages
Page `<title>` should be a descriptive title, rather than a filename

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

 * Change the text in the `<title>` element to a meaningful description of the page purpose.  A filename is not an appropriate title for a Web page. 
 
 For example:
```
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>IBM Accessibility</title>
</head>
```

</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
