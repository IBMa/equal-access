## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People who physically cannot use a pointing device

## Why is this important?

Setting the `tabindex` value to 0 or -1 on a child element not focusable by default ensures the UI component will be included in the tab sequence and receive focus for keyboard access. Using values greater than 0 should be avoided as it can break the logical tab order.

## UI component has no focusable child element
UI component must have at least one focusable child element for keyboard access

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

Set the value of the `tabindex` attribute equal to 0 or -1 on at least one of the required child elements to include the UI component in the tab sequence. 
The following example shows a component with `role="tree"` with its required child with `role="treeitem"`. The child contains `tabindex="0"` which makes the `treeitem` keyboard operable:

```
<div role="tree" aria-label="Tree Widget" id="tree1" onkeypress="keyEvent();">
    <div id="item1" role="treeitem" tabindex="0">Tree item</div>
</div>  
```

</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
