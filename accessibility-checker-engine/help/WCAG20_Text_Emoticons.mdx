## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using a screen reader
* People using text-based browsers (e.g., Lynx) or audio interfaces

## Why is this important?

Emoticons include ASCII characters that form facial expressions and other ways to communicate an emotion to the user. Though they are very popular, they can be confusing for people who use assistive technology. Providing a text alternative makes the information accessible through audio or other channels.

## Check that emoticons have a text alternative

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* When possible, use a word like "smile" instead of an emoticon;
* OR, if this element is an emoticon, verify there is a text alternative immediately before or after it.
