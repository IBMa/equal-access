## Who does this affect?

 * Blind people using a screen reader
 * People using text only, monochrome or braille displays
 * People using text-based browsers (e.g., Lynx) or audio interfaces

## Why is this important?

The HTML `<q>` and `<blockquote>` elements tell assistive technologies such as screen readers which content is part of a quotation or citation. Any such text must be included in the appropriate element that enables assistive technology users to understand its meaning and purpose.

## If the following text is a quotation, mark it as a `<q>` or `<blockquote>` element: "{0}"
Quotations should be marked with `<q>` or `<blockquote>` elements

</div>

## What to do

 * Verify the text is not a quotation;
 * OR, if the quotation is 10 words or less, enclose it in a `<q>` element;
 * OR, for a longer quotation, enclose it in a `<blockquote>` element.

For example:

```
<p>As she walked up she said, <q>Hi, my name is Natasha.</q></p>

<p>Quotation from <cite="http://www.shakespeare.com/loveslabourlost">Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
	Painfully to pore upon a book
	To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
	Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
</blockquote>
```
