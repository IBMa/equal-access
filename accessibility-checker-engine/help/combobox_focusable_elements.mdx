### Tabbable focus is not set correctly within the combobox or related popup

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Tabbable focus for the combobox must be allowable only on the text input, except when using a dialog popup

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

A combobox is a UI interactive component that combines an input and another element, such as a listbox
or grid, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set the value of the input. When a combobox 
receives focus, the focus should be set on the text `<input>` element that can either display the 
current value or supports editing, so people who use assistive technologies are able to accurately 
navigate and interact with the content.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Unless the `has-popup` attribute value is `dialog`, set the initial DOM focus only on the combobox’s `<input>` element.

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
