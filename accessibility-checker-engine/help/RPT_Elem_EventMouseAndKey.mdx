## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with low vision
* People with tremor or other movement disorders
* People who rely on keyboard control

## Why is this important?

Scripted mouse-specific event handlers can be used to trigger actions on graphical user interface (GUI) controls. Equivalent keyboard-specific handlers allow individuals who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to access the same functionality.

All interactive content with mouse event handlers must have equivalent keyboard access

## What to do

* Using only the keyboard, make sure you can access all the functionality provided by the mouse event handlers.
* AND, if there is no equivalent keyboard access, follow the event handler table below to provide the corresponding keyboard event handlers:

| Use           | with          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| onmousedown   | onkeydown     |
| onmouseup     | onkeyup       |
| onclick       | onkeypress    |
| onmouseover   | onfocus 		|
| onmouseout    | onblur        |
