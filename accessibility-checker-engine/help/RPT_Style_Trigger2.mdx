## Why is this important?

Windows High Contrast mode alters the way Web content is displayed by disabling certain CSS features. Applications that use CSS background images for any component may have issues including the disappearance of images or UI elements when Windows High Contrast mode is enabled. Another example is the disappearance of visual focus indicators and visual alterations of UI elements with Windows High Contrast mode enabled.
