## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with low vision using a screen reader

## Why is this important?

Elements with a `"region"` role must have a label that describes the purpose of the region. This information helps people using assistive technologies to find and navigate the region.

## An element with a `"region"` role does not have a label
Elements with a `"region"` role must have a label that describes their purpose

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* If there is visible text that appropriately describes the region's purpose, set the region element's `"aria-labelledby"` attribute to the `"id"` value of that text (example below);
* OR, use the `"aria-label"` attribute to add a label directly to the element with the `"region"` role.

For example, the HTML `<section>` element has an implicit role of `"region"`:
```
<section aria-labelledby="log1">
	<h3 id="log1">Real time log</h3>
	This is the text contained within the landmark region...
</section>
```
