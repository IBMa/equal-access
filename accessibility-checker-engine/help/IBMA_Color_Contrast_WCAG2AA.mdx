## Who does this affect?

 * People with moderately low vision who do not use a contrast-enhancing technology
 * People with visual impairment using color contrast enhancement
 * People who cannot see color, have limited color vision or have color blindness

## Why is this important?

When text and its background colors have less than a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio it can be difficult for people with moderately low vision to read the text without a contrast-enhancing technology. For larger text of 18 points or more, or bold 14 point text, the text and background colors must give at least a 3 to 1 contrast ratio.

## Text contrast of `<{0}>` with the background is less than the requirement of "{3}"
Color contrast of text with its background must meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum requirements
