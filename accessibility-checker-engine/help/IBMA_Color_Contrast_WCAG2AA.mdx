### Text contrast of {0} with its background is less than the WCAG AA minimum requirements for text of size {1}px and weight of {2}

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Color contrast of text with its background must meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum requirements

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When text and its background colors have less than a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio it can be difficult for people with moderately low vision to read the text without a contrast-enhancing technology. For larger text of 18 point or more, or bold 14 point text, the text and background colors must give at least a 3 to 1 contrast ratio.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * For large text that is at least 18 point or at least 14 point when bold, adjust the color of the text or its background to give at least a 3 to 1 contrast ratio;
 * OR, for body text that is less than 18 point or less than 14 point when bold, adjust the color of the text or its background to give at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio.
