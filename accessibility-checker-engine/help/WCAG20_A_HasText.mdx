## Hyperlink has no description of its purpose
Hyperlinks must have link text, a label or an image with a text alternative

[IBM 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in Context)](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/link_purpose.html) | [WCAG 2.1 technique H30](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H30) | [WCAG 2.1 technique ARIA7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA7)

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* Ideally, add unique link text as the content of the hyperlink that describes the purpose of the hyperlink;
* OR If it’s not possible to use unique link text (e.g. multiple ‘Read more..’ links for different topics), use the `aria-labelledby` attribute to point to text visible on the page that identifies the link purpose.  The following example shows how the `aria-labelledby` provides additional context by adding the text 'Breaking News' from the header to the link text 'Read more..':

```
<h2 id="topic1">Breaking News</h2>
<p>The central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage to protect economy.
<a id="p1" href="news.html" aria-labelledby="p1 topic1">Read more...</a></p>
```

</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
