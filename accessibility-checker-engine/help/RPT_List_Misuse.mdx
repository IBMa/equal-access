## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with low vision using screen readers

## Why is this important?

Lists add structural information that helps users navigate without vision. Using list markup improperly hinders accessibility by making it difficult for users with specialized software to understand the organization of the page or to navigate through it.
