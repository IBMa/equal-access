## Who does this affect?

 * People who are deaf or hard of hearing
 * People in noisy or very quiet environments
 * People in a situation where they cannot use audio on their devices

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

 * Verify that the live media has closed captions (embeds the dialogue and important sounds as text in a way that is not visible unless the user requests it);
 * OR, verify that the live media has open captions (embeds the dialogue and important sounds as text in the video track);
 * OR, add captions to the live media.
