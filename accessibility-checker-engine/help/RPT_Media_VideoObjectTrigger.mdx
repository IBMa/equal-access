### Verify captions are provided for live media (streaming video with audio)

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Live media (streaming video with audio) should have captions for audio content

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Providing captions for real-time presentations enables viewers to understand the audio content when they cannot hear it, or the sound is off.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify that the live media has closed captions (embeds the dialogue and important sounds as text in a way that is not visible unless the user requests it);
 * OR, verify that the live media has open captions (embeds the dialogue and important sounds as text in the video track);
 * OR, add captions to the live media.

</Column>
