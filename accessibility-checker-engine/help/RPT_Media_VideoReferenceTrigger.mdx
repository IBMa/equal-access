### Why is this important?

By providing an additional audio track, users can choose to replace the original video sound track with one that includes information that focuses on actions, characters, or scene changes that are important to understanding the content. This is sometimes referred to as an 'audio description', as in 'a description in audio format', and should not be confused with captions.
