## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using a screen reader

## Why is this important?

If a WAI-ARIA `role` attribute is specified for an element, any WAI-ARIA child elements required for that role must also be present. Child elements' native WAI-ARIA roles satisfy the requirement - the role does not have to be explicitly set. Without the required child elements, assistive technologies may not be able to accurately represent or interact with the element.

<div id="locLevel" className="level-violation">Needs review</div>

## An element with WAI-ARIA `role="{0}"` does not contain or own at least one child element with each of the following WAI-ARIA roles: `{1}`
An element with WAI-ARIA `role` must contain required children

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

 * Add the appropriate required child element(s) to this element.

For example, the following element uses the `"radiogroup"` role. The `"radiogroup"` role requires child elements with `role="radio"` set in a manner that represents the checked or unchecked state of the radio button.

```
<div role="radiogroup">
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="false"></div>
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="true"></div>
</div>
```

Example with an implicit role:

```
<table role= "treegrid">
	 <tr>
   	  <td>
    		element with role= "treegrid" requires child element with role="row".
    		TR has implicit WAI-ARIA role="row", so the condition is met
   	  <td>
	 <tr>
</table>
```

</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
