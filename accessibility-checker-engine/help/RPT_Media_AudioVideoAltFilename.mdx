## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using a screen reader
* People using text-based browsers (e.g., Lynx) or audio interfaces

## Why is this important?

Proper text alternatives convey the meaning of what the non-text content such as audio or video content is. Placeholder text or filenames are not viable labels because they do not convey function or information; for example, filenames such as "video.jpg" or "interviewOct.wav".

## Filename used as label for embedded audio or video
Audio or video on the page must have a short text alternative that describes the media content

[IBM 1.1.1 Non-text content](http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/non_text_content.html)

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* Provide a short text alternative as a label that describes the content of the audio or video on the page.

For example: A video feed in NY Times has the following descriptive label "Video of the fine dining place 'Clay Pit' located in downtown Austin, TX."
