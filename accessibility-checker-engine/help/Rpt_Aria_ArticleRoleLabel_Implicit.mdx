## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers

## Why is this important?

Elements with a role of `"article"` must have an associated label. This information helps people using assistive technologies to find and navigate the content. The HTML `<article>` element has an implicit role of `"article"`.

</Column>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

<div id="locLevel" className="level-violation">Violation</div>

## Element with `"article"` role does not have a label
All elements with role of `"article"` must have a label that describes their purpose

[IBM 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks](http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/bypass_blocks.html) | [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Article Role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#article)

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* If there is visible text that appropriately describes the purpose of the article, set the element's `aria-labelledby` attribute value to the `id` value of that text (example below);
* OR, use the `aria-label` attribute to add a label directly to the element with the `"article"` role.

For example:
```
<h1 id="news">Breaking news</h1>
...
<div role="article" aria-labelledby="news">
    ...
</div>
```


</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
