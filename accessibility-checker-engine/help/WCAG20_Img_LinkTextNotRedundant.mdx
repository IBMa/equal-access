### Link text is repeated in an image `alt` attribute

<div id="locLevel"></div>

 The text alternative for an image within a link should not repeat the link text or adjacent link text

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

When the text equivalent of an image inside or adjacent to a link is the same as the link text, people with visual impairments who use a screen reader will hear the same text announced twice. Also those who use text only browsers will see both the link text and text equivalent of the image, and can be confused by the redundant text.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If a link has text and a redundant image, set the image `alt` attribute to `alt=“”` (null alt without any spaces);
* OR If a link has text and an image that adds important information to the text, set the image `alt` attribute to convey the added information.
  (e.g. `<a><img alt="urgent">new mail</a>`);
* OR If adjacent links have different targets but the same text, change the link text or the `alt` attribute on the image to distinguish the purpose of each link;
* OR If adjacent links have the same target, combine them into a single link and set the image `alt` attribute to `alt=“”`.
