### Verify that captions are available for any meaningful audio or provide a caption track for the `<video>` element

<div id="locLevel"></div>

A `<video>` element must have a text alternative for any meaningful audio content

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Text tracks or open captions contain a textual transcription of audio aspects of video content in a synchronized media. This may include the dialog, sound effects, and relevant musical cues. Providing text alternatives (captions) makes information available that some people would not have access to otherwise.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* If the video has any meaningful audio and no captions, then provide closed captions using the `<track>` element;
* OR make sure the video has live captions, usually done by professional real-time captioners (also called Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) providers).

For example:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>&lt;video src="..."&gt;
      &lt;track src="myvideo.srt" kind="captions" &gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</CodeSnippet>
