## Who does this affect?

 * Blind people using a screen reader
 * People with reading disabilities
 * People who view interfaces using an adapted layout

## Why is this important?

Simply adding blank characters to control the spacing may change the meaning, pronunciation or the interpretation of the word or cause the word not to be programmatically recognized as a single word.
