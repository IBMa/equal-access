## What to do

 * Verify that the audio content is also available in text form;
 * OR, provide a transcript of the audio.

For example, a link to an audio file containing a speech would be followed by a link to a page with a transcript:

```
    Jeremy Flint's <a href="bc30.wav">podcast on disability rights</a>
    <a href="bc30.txt">transcript</a>)
```
