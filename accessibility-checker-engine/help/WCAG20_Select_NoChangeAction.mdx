## Who does this affect?

 * Blind people using a screen reader
 * People with low vision using screen magnification
 * People who rely on keyboard control
 * People with dexterity impairment
 * People with cognitive limitations

## Why is this important?

When using the `<select>` element, the user should be allowed to control when an action is performed, rather than having an action occur as a side effect of choosing a value. This mechanism provides the user with an opportunity to inspect the different values of the `<select>` element, or to correct a choice. When the user is satisfied with their choice, they can select a button to perform the action. This interaction is particularly important for users who are choosing the value of the `<select>` element via the keyboard, because navigating through the options of the `<select>` element changes the value of the control and would otherwise submit the value after seeing only the first option.
