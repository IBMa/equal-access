## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers who cannot see the context around the control
* People with dexterity impairment using voice control

## Why is this important?

Associating a meaningful label with every UI control allows the browser and assistive technology to expose and announce the control to a user. Associating a visible label also provides a larger clickable area.

<div id="locLevel" className="level-violation">Violation</div>

## The UI control `<{0}>` has no label
Each UI control must have an associated label

[IBM 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/labels_or_instructions.html) | [WCAG 2.1 technique H44](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44) | [WCAG 2.1 technique ARIA16](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA16.html)

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* Add a `for` attribute to a visible label with the `id` of this control (e.g. `<label for="controlID">`);
* OR put the UI element inside a visible `<label>` element;
* OR add an `aria-labelledby` attribute to the control. It must point to visible text on the page that is meaningful as a label;
* OR only if the design cannot have a visible label, use the `title` attribute to provide a label.
