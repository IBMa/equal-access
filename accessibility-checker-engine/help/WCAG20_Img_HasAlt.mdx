## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People who turn off image-loading on their web browsers
* People using text only, monochrome or braille displays
* People using text-based browsers (e.g., Lynx) or audio interfaces

## Why is this important

When an image contains important information, providing a text alternative makes the same information accessible through audio or other channels.

## Image does not have a short text alternative
Images that convey meaning must have a short text alternative

[IBM 1.1.1 Non-text content](http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/non_text_content.html) | [WCAG 2.1 technique H37](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37)

<div id="elementLocation">
</div>

## What to do

* If the image conveys meaning, use the `alt` attribute on the `<img>` element to provide a short description that serves the same purpose as the image. If the image contains important words, include them in the short description (e.g. `<img alt="submit">`);
* OR, if the image is decorative or redundant, use the `alt` attribute with an empty string as its value (e.g. `<img alt="">`).
