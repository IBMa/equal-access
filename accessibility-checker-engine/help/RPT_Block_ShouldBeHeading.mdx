## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People with cognitive differences who view interfaces using an adapted layout

## Check text that looks like a heading but is not within a heading element
Heading text must use a heading element

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

 * If this text is intended to be a heading, use the `<h>` elements (h1-h6) rather than style alone to define heading text (e.g. `<h2>Section 1</h2>`);
 * OR, use other markup so the element's semantic meaning is exposed to assistive technology that is appropriate for the content of the element.
