### Check if a page is being caused to refresh automatically

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Pages should not refresh automatically

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Some individuals might need more time to read or interact with a page than the author expects. If the page auto-refreshes while they are still reading/working, it might prevent access to content by resetting their location on the page.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Remove the `<META>` tag that causes an automatic page refresh (e.g. `<META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="10">`) and use a different method to update information on the page;
 * OR, provide an option to turn off, extend, or adjust the timing of the page refresh;
 * OR, at the top of the page, provide a single line of explanation and link to a non-refreshing page. For example "This page automatically reloads every 10 seconds. A `<a href="..."> non-updating equivalent page </a>` with a refresh button is available."

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
