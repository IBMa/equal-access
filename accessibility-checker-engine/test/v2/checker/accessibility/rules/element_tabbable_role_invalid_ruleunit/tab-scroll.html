    The indeterminate property sets or returns whether the state of a checkbox has changed.

    Checkboxes actually has three states: true, false and indeterminate which indicates that a checkbox is neither "on" or "off".
    
    A checkbox cannot be set to indeterminate state by an HTML attribute - it must be set by a JavaScript.
    
    This state can be used to force the user to check or uncheck the checkbox.
