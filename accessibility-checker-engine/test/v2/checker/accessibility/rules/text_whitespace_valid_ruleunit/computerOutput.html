<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example of a member-scope Locking report</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Locking reports are helpful in monitoring the locking of
page sets.</p>
<p class="p">If you want to monitor deadlocks and timeouts on shared databases,
and if you want this information grouped by individual members, generate
a Lockout report for every member. Because group-scope reports are
available in the Locking report set, this report is called a member-scope
report.</p>
<p class="p">Member-scope reports also provide group-scope information because
holders and waiters of lockups are shown. Member scope and group scope
only influence the summarization of the report.</p>
<p class="p">To generate a member-scope Locking report, specify the following
command stream: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>⋮
LOCKING
   REPORT
      LEVEL (LOCKOUT)
      ORDER(DATABASE-PAGESET)
⋮</code></pre>
<p class="p">Member-scope report is the default, so you are not required
to specify the SCOPE subcommand option. To order the report by page
set within a database, specify the ORDER subcommand option.</p>
<p class="p">The following example shows a member-scope Locking report for group
DSHGRPXX, which has two members, FIRST and SECOND. The report is two
pages long because a new page is started when the member that is being
reported changes.</p>
<div class="example" id="ko2ru00253__dshg21"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Member-scope Locking Lockout report, page
1</h2><p class="p">The first page of the report shows the locking activity
of the threads that have executed in member FIRST.</p>
