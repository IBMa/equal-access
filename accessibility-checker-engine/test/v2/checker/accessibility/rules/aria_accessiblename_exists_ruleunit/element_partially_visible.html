        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more
        accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with
        disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement,
        speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities
        and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines
        address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines
        will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
