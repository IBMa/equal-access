        <p>
            Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more
            accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with
            disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement,
            speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities
            and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines
            address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines
            will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
