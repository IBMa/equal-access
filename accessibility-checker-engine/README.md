# accessibility-checker-engine

This README covers topics for developers who want to better understand the rules and build the engine component.

- For information on creating and modifying the rules, see [README-RULES](README-RULES.md).
- For information on installing the engine in a Node or browser environment, see [README-NPM](README-NPM.md).

## Overview

`accessibility-checker-engine` contains accessibility rules and an evaluation engine to help users to check their web pages to identify and report accessibility issues.

## Accessibility Requirements and Rulesets

The `"IBM Accessibility"` ruleset is based on the [IBM Accessibility Requirements](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/), which is unified list of worldwide standards and regulations as described in the [release notes](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/release-notes).

The rules test conformance against the standards and specifications such as the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/).
The rules are harmonized with open rules published by the [W3C ACT-Rules Community](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/) group as reported in the [IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker ACT implementation report](https://wai-wcag-act-rules.netlify.app/standards-guidelines/act/implementations/equal-access/).
`Rulesets` are also provided for `"WCAG 2.1 (A,AA)"` and `"WCAG 2.0 (A,AA)"`.

Mappings of the latest rules to the standards, the individual failure messages, and links to the Help files explaining _Why it is important_ and _What to do_ are listed in the [Checker rule sets](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/checker-rule-sets).

## Install and build

Review [equal-access/README](../README.md) on how to clone the source.
Once the source code is cloned to your local environment, you can build the source code based on the requirements of your local environment.

### build ace.js that can be used in a browser environment

```bash
$ cd accessibility-checker-engine
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This will build the ace.js in the dist directory.

### build ace-node.js that can be used in a NodeJS environment

```
$ cd accessibility-checker-engine
$ npm install
$ npm run build-node
```

This will build the ace-node.js in the dist directory.

## API

The most important entry point API is the `check` method of `ace.Checker` object. You can use a callback or Promise mechanism to retrieve the accessibility results for further processing in your javascript or NodeJS program.

```javascript
const checker = new ace.Checker();
checker.check(doc, ["IBM_Accessibility"])
    .then(function(report) {
        // process accessibility report here
    });  
```

* `doc` - can be one of: 
  * a Document Object Model (`DOM`) object representing an HTML document which is usually available in a browser environment as `document`
  * a `DOM` element representing a fragment HTML which can be retrieved from a `DOM` by matching against one or more selectors.
* `["IBM_Accessibility"]` - apply IBM accessibility ruleset.
* `report` - accessibility results contains identified accessibility issues and their descriptions from the given `doc`, and a summary of the issues. The report is in JSON format (see [details](#report)).

## Report

The accessibility report is in JSON format, and contains information about the identified accessibility issues and their descriptions.

```javascript
{
    report: {
        scanID: "18504e0c-fcaa-4a78-a07c-4f96e433f3e7",

}
```

## Usage examples

This section provides `"AS-IS"` code examples, snippets, or logic. The users are expected to make changes according to their environments.

### Command-line in a browser developer tool

You can use the wrapper method `checkDemo` in `ace` object, which is specifically created for checking accessibility in a browser developer tool. The `checkDemo` method outputs both raw accessibility results in JSON format, and the results sorted by elements identified by their xPath. Following are the example steps to use  `ace.checkDemo()` to display the results in a Chrome developer tool:

* Navigate to a page or type the url to the page in Chrome browser
* Open the developer tool in Chrome browser: click `Customize and Control Google Chrome` button, select `More Tools`, then select `Developer Tool`
* Select `Console` tab to show command prompt
* Open the `ace.js` you built in the build step in a text editor, select and copy all the content
* Paste the content you copied to the command prompt in the developer tool, then press `Enter`
* Type in the command prompt: `ace.checkDemo()`, then `Enter`

You can view the accessibility report for the page:  
![use ACE in the Chrome developer tool](img/use-awe-in-developer-tool.png "Use ACE in the Chrome developer tool to test accessibility of a web page")

### Programmatic

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use ACE to test a web page for accessibility in an embedded Chrome environment (`puppeteer`). See [accessibility-checker](../accessibility-checker) for a more complete tool for this environment.

```javascript
(async () => {
  const chromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');
  const axios = require('axios');
  const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
  
  // Initialize a Chrome instance
  const chrome = await chromeLauncher.launch({
    //chromeFlags: ['--headless'],
    logLevel: 'info',
    output: 'json'
  });
  const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:${chrome.port}/json/version`);
  const { webSocketDebuggerUrl } = response.data;

  // Connect puppeteer to the chrome instance using the endpoint
  const browser = await puppeteer.connect({ browserWSEndpoint: webSocketDebuggerUrl });

  //get the page
  const [page] = await browser.pages();

  // inject the ace.js into the page when domcontentloaded event is fired, assuming the ace.js is in the same folder
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000', { waitUtil: 'domcontentloaded' });
  await page.addScriptTag({ path: path.join(__dirname, 'ace.js') });

  //invoke the ace to evaluate the page for accessibility
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    const checker = new ace.Checker();
    checker.check(document, ["IBM_Accessibility"])
        .then(function (report) {
            for (let idx = 0; idx < report.results.length; ++idx) {
                //process the report
            }
        });
  });
})();
```

### Browser extensions

You can use the [accessibility-checker-extension](../accessibility-checker-extension) for Chrome or Firefox. The browser extensions integrate the accessibility web engine (ace.js) and formatted results into the browser developer tool to visually view the accessibility issues and the locations of violating components. For more information and instructions, review [accessibility-checker-extensions](../accessibility-checker-extension).

### Integration with test frameworks

You can use the [karma-accessibility-checker](../karma-accessibility-checker) to integrate accessibility web engine into [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) test framework. For more information and instructions, view [karma-accessibility-checker](../karma-accessibility-checker).

You can use the [cypress-accessibility-checker](../cypress-accessibility-checker) to integrate automated accessibility testing into [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. For more information and instructions, view [cypress-accessibility-checker](../cypress-accessibility-checker).
