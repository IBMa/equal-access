    "1.3.1": "Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.",
    "1.3.2": "When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.",
    "1.3.3": "Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.",
    "1.3.4": "Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape.",
    "1.3.5": "The purpose of each input field that collects information about the user can be programmatically determined when the field serves a common purpose.",
    "1.4.1": "Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.",
    "1.4.2": "If any audio plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.",

    "1.4.4": "Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.",
    "1.4.5": "If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text should not be used to convey information rather than images of text.",
    "1.4.10": "Content can reflow without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions.",
    "1.4.11": "The parts of graphical objects required to understand the content, and the visual information required to identify UI components and states, have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors.",
    "1.4.12": "No loss of content or functionality occurs when users change letter, word and paragraph spacing, as well as line height.",
    "1.4.13": "Where hover or focus actions cause additional content to become visible and hidden, the additional content is dismissable, hoverable and persistent.",
    "2.1.1": "All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.",
    "2.1.2": "If keyboard focus can be moved to a component using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.",
    "2.1.4": "If a keyboard shortcut is implemented using only letter, punctuation, number or symbol characters, then the shortcut can be turned off, remapped or activated only on focus.",
    "2.2.1": "For each time limit that is set by the content, the user can turn off, adjust, or extend the limit.",
    "2.2.2": "For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, the user can pause, stop, hide or adjust the information.",
    "2.3.1": "Content does not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.",

    "2.4.2": "Web pages, non-web documents, and software have titles that describe topic or purpose.",
    "2.4.3": "If content can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.",
    "2.4.4": "The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link content.",
    "2.4.5": "More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages, except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a process.",
    "2.4.6": "Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.",
    "2.4.7": "Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.",
    "2.5.1": "All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture.",
    "2.5.2": "For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, completion of the function is on the up-event with an ability to abort, undo or reverse the outcome.",
    "2.5.3": "For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the accessible name contains the text that is presented visually.",
    "2.5.4": "Functionality that can be operated by motion can also be operated by user interface components, and the motion trigger can be disabled.",
    "3.1.1": "The default human language of Web pages, non-Web documents, or software can be programmatically determined.",
    "3.1.2": "The human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined.",
    "3.2.1": "When any component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context.",
    "3.2.2": "Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.",
    "3.2.3": "Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.",
    "3.2.4": "Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.",
    "3.3.1": "If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text.",
    "3.3.2": "Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.",
    "3.3.3": "If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.",
    "3.3.4": "For content that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, the user can reverse, correct, or confirm the action.",
    "4.1.1": "In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.",
    "4.1.2": "For all user interface components (including, but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.",
    "4.1.3": "In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.",
