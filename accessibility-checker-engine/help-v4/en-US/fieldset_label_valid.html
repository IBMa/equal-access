### Why is this important?

A label associated with a group of related input elements also serves as a common label for individual inputs in the group. 
Assistive technologies (AT) can indicate the start and end of the group and the group’s label as the user navigates into and out of the group.
AT needs to be able to present the group label with each input control to remind users with which group they are part.
When there are multiple groups with the same input elements then the label of the group needs to be unique so it can be distinguished.

For example, in a retail scenario where two groups of input elements represent _Name, Address, City, and Zip_, 
the groups need to be distinguished from one another by labelling one group "_Mailing address_" and the other "_Shipping address_".

<div id="locSnippet"></div>


### What to do

* Provide a unique label for a group of form controls using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements  
* **Or**, distinguish multiple `role="group"` elements with a unique `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label`  
* **Or**, for a group of radio buttons, use `role="radiogroup"` instead of `role="group"`
