### Why is this important?

When text and its background colors have less than a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio it can be difficult for people with moderately low vision to read the text without a contrast-enhancing technology. For larger text of 18 point or more, or bold 14 point text, the text and background colors must give at least a 3 to 1 contrast ratio.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * For large text that is at least 18 point or at least 14 point when bold, adjust the color of the text or its background to give at least a 3 to 1 contrast ratio;
 * **Or**, for body text that is less than 18 point or less than 14 point when bold, adjust the color of the text or its background to give at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio.

### About this requirement

* [IBM 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#1_4_3)
* [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G18)
* [G145: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G145)

### Who does this affect?

 * People with moderately low vision who do not use a contrast-enhancing technology
 * People with visual impairment using color contrast enhancement
 * People who cannot see color, have limited color vision or have color blindness
