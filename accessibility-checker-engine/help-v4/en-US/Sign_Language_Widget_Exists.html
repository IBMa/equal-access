### Why is this important?
The Deaf's native language is Sign Language which is a visual language with its own structure, it is completely different from written language.

Over 80% of the Deaf community do not read beyond a very basic level, making websites and social content inaccessible to them.

Avatars deliver instant translation from text to Sign Language to help companies, governments and organizations become accessible for the Deaf community.

### What to do

 * Install a sign language widget, which translates your website to sign language, if you're not able make a <div> element with the id 'DeafTranslate'
 
 For example:
 
```
<div id="DeafTranslate"></div>
```
