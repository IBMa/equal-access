### Why is this important?

Within an element with the role `"application"`, only focusable elements are accessible to users of some assistive technologies by default.
Therefore, to ensure access to any non-decorative static text or image content that does not receive focus by default, it must be implemented in an accessible way.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* Verify that the content is decorative
* **Or**, associate the content with a focusable element using the `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute
* **Or**, place the content in a focusable element that has role `"document"` or `"article"`
* **Or**, manage the focus of descendants as described in [Developing a Keyboard Interface](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/) by updating the value of `aria-activedescendant` to reference the element containing the focused content
* **And if**, the application provides assistive technology, use platform and other industry standard accessibility services
