### Why is this important?

When using the `<select>` element, the user should be allowed to control when an action is performed,
rather than having an action occur as a side effect of choosing a value.
This mechanism allows the user to inspect the different values of the `<select>` element, or to correct a choice.
When the user is satisfied with their choice, they can select a button to act.
This interaction is particularly important for users who choose the value of the `<select>` element via the keyboard,
because navigating through the options of the `<select>` element changes the value of the control and would otherwise submit the value after seeing only the first option.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Use the keyboard to navigate to and within the `<select>` component
 * **And**, verify that when each selection option receives focus, no [change of context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-focus.html#dfn-changes-of-context) is triggered

### About this requirement

* [IBM 3.2.1 On Focus](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#3_2_1)
* [G107: Using "activate" rather than "focus"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G107)

### Who does this affect?

 * People using a screen reader, including blind, low vision, and neurodivergentt people
 * People with low vision using screen magnification
 * People who rely on keyboard control
 * People with dexterity impairment
 * People with cognitive limitations
