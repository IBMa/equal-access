### Why is this important?

Visible labels are essential, so every user can know what information to enter:
- People with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, older adults, and all users will easily learn what information is expected.
- People using voice control will see what to speak. This allows them to easily jump to interactive elements and form fields.

Placeholder labels when used as the only visible label can reduce the accessibility for a wide range of users. Avoid placeholder labels for the following reasons:
- May not be persistent: the placeholder label disappears when the user starts typing in the input field
- Can be mistaken for a pre-filled value: this can be more of an issue in AI applications
- Hard to see: the text color commonly fails a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1
- May be too small: the lack of a label reduces the hit region for setting focus on the input field in touch devices

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

The intent of labels, including expected formats and required fields, 
on interactive elements is not to clutter the page with unnecessary information but to provide important cues that will benefit all users. 
Too much information can be just as harmful as too little.

**If** there is already a visible label for the element, use an attribute on the label to reference the element's id
- **Or**, add a visible label with an attribute or coding construct associating it to the element.
    
**If** using the placeholder attribute, ensure it is a short hint to aid the user with data entry,
- **And**, use a valid label method that is both visible and programmatically determined.
    
**If** a visible label cannot be added,
- **Either**, make a label or instructions available to users when the individual control has focus (both keyboard and pointer),
- **Or**, verify the input field and interactive element is understood within the context or instructions.
    
Examples:

```
<label for="test1">License Number:</label>
    <input type="text" id="test1" aria-label="Enter driver license number"/>
<label for="test2">First name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="test2"/>
<label>Email Address: 
    <input type="email" name="address1" placeholder="john@example.net">
</label>
```
