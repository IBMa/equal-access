### Why is this important?

    This rule assumes that the presence of one of the roles outlined in the applicability 
    indicates the authorâ€™s intent to include the element in the accessibility tree 
    and thus convey information to the user about that element.

An SVG component with a graphics role can contain important information as well as multiple shapes.
When viewed together, these elements give the impression of a single image.
Providing a text alternative makes the equivalent information available through assistive technologies.    
With the explicit use of roles, the author provides a clear indication that the content should convey meaning via the accessibility tree to assistive technology users.

Note: Until browser support for SVG's implicit `graphics-document` role, `<title>`, and `<desc>` elements and the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam-1.0/#mapping_role_table) is more consistent, 
it is recommended to explicitly remove _decorative_ SVG elements from the accessibility tree so the assistive technology user is not confused.

<!-- This is where the code snippet is injected -->
<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do
Ensure the _non-decorative_ element has an _accessible name_ that is not empty:
* Add an `aria-labelledby` attribute to the element with a `role="graphics-*"`. It must point to visible text on the page that is meaningful as a label
* **Or**, add an `aria-label` attribute to the element with a `role="graphics-*"`
* **Or**, only if the design cannot have a visible label, use the `title` attribute to provide a label


Example:

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> ... <circle role="graphics-symbol" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle></svg>
```
