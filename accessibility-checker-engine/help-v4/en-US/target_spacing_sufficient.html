### Why is this important?

Some people with physical impairments cannot click or touch small buttons that are close together, especially on mobile touch screens. 

The requirement intends to provide adequate clearance from any adjacent elements to prevent accidental activation of adjacent elements.
The requirement also intends to provide a larger display region that will accept a touch or pointer action when elements overlap
and in other situations where the target size may be smaller than that of the element.

Even though exceptions, such as an “**_inline link in body text,_**” are listed in [IBM 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/?version=v7_3#2_5_8),
increasing the size and spacing is recommended.

Note: A _minimum spacing_ is required when a _minimum size_ cannot be met.
Therefore, it is possible to have small elements and meet the requirement,
provided that the elements do not have any adjacent elements that are too close.
It is recommended to meet the minimum size requirement regardless of spacing.
For important links and controls,
consider aiming for the stricter [2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-enhanced) of at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels.

### What to do

- Increase the size of the element's target 
- **Or**, increase the spacing around the target
- **Or**, ensure the function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets the minimum size and spacing requirement

### About this requirement

- [IBM 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/?version=v7_3#2_5_8)
- [C42: Sufficient min-height and min-width target spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C42)

### Who does this affect?

- People who use a mobile device where the touch screen is the primary mode of interaction
- People with tremors or other movement disorders using a mouse, stylus, or touch input
- People using a device in environments where they are exposed to shaking, such as public transportation
- People with large fingers or who are operating the device with only a part of their finger or knuckle
- People using a device with only one hand
- Many older adults or other users who have difficulty with fine motor movements
